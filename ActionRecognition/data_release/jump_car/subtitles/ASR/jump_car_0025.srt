9
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,770
will come with to read clamps

10
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,090
and two black claims identify the
battery posts are both batteries

11
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,010
positive will have anything red
associate with the red

12
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:17,040
cover the red clamps the little positive
symbol right there

13
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,470
on the negative side you love black
cables

14
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,680
and a a little negative symbol right
there

15
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,010
sometimes it's very difficult to find
any coloring or any samples

16
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,190
one trick us look at the size the post
the positive is going to be much larger

17
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,250
in diameter

18
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,560
than the negative post it's best to know
which is which

19
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:41,600
because the hookup backwards you can
have serious electrical problems

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,110
were still as your battery discharges it
starts to emit a hydrogen gas

21
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:54,490
makes that was far and it what

22
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,960
you get what I'm sayin now you attach
the to read clamps

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,190
it doesn't really matter what order
because you're not getting a final

24
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:02,930
contact

25
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,770
notice i've wiggle the clamps

26
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:12,050
to get better contact that allowing the
black clamp touch any exposed metal

27
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,940
areas good plastic bumper like this is
good now you attach the black clamp

28
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,370
to the car that you're starting it with
on the negative post for your final

29
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,020
connection

30
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,730
and this is the one that counts wanna
find exposed metal location on your

31
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,250
engine

32
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,190
and clampett to it now

33
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:37,450
electricity will flow from the live
battery to the dead battery I recommend

34
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,250
you in the car with a live battery

35
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,250
to increase the flow of electricity in
fact

36
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,440
you can reading the end

37
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,469
faster like

38
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:57,150
hurt

39
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,220
I now try to start if it doesn't start
right away

40
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,810
it's no problem you'll just need to
spend more time waiting to charge that

41
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,530
dead

42
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:12,890
battery call

43
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:18,680
Paul

44
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,799
price target again

45
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:25,209
way yes

46
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:28,260
it okay I'll

47
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,690
cars running now pretty badly the cable
dangling from the front of the car that

48
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,670
struck down the road so I'd suggest you
disconnect the cable

49
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,640
starting with the last one the hookup
that your negative

50
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,280
plant spark is just as important this
time so make sure to let it go against

51
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,290
your plastic bumper

52
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,680
from there you can't disconnect the
cable
