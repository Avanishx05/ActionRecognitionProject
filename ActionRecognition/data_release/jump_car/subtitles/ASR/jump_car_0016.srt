11
00:00:00,989 --> 00:00:04,559
firstly check a flat battery for any
signs of damage

12
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:07,660
simpson's tracks or leaks

13
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,790
never try to jumpstart a car

14
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,670
with atomic stop as there can be a risk
of explosion

15
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,550
of fire not we need a fully charge card
to take power from

16
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,800
cars can be jump-started from

17
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,140
any other heart with the seam voltage
battery fitted

18
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,690
most European cars operate a 12-fold

19
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,000
system so check that both the flight on
the charge batteries

20
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,610
much ideally the charge should come from

21
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:43,830
a similar are larger hired car look keep
the battery position

22
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,090
and both cars them Park the fully charge
card opposite

23
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,599
to the dead car allowing a walking down
between them

24
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:57,509
and turn off the and we know it connects
the batteries together

25
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:00,869
using I jump lease which must be done
and

26
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:04,470
this connect one of the red

27
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,539
keep a lens to the positive terminal on
the dead battery

28
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:11,770
this will be identified with a plus sign

29
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:17,810
on is often read and Connor connected
opposite and

30
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:23,270
of the red cable to the positive
terminal on charged spotted

31
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,010
attach the blacks cable to the negative
terminal

32
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:32,930
on the charged marked with a minus sign

33
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,990
and finally the opposite and

34
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,050
of the black people to the negative
terminal

35
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:42,040
on the dead battery and some instances
this can be

36
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,540
connected any middle point with and the
cars

37
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,590
engine bay insurer that the cable

38
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,880
ends I kept part during this process

39
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,110
ensure that all electrical items

40
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,290
with an each car are switched off such
us

41
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,990
lights heaters and radios this makes it

42
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,080
easier to start the car by using less
Park

43
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,710
start the fully charged on

44
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,650
letter mom for three to five minutes

45
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:17,490
revving the engine as you do so nyse:

46
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,640
attempt to stop the car with Prof laptop

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,830
should start straight away if not

48
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,580
leave the cars connected for a few
months to

49
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,890
allowed charge to build up before trying
again

50
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,630
once the car has been started remove

51
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:38,270
leads in the river sequence take off

52
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,440
the negative on the flat battery phone

53
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,130
by negative on the charged battery in

54
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,420
the positive on charged pottery

55
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,630
and finally positive on the flop
