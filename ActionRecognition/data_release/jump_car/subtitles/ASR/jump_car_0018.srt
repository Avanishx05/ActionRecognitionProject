26
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,280
with your good vehicle with the bathtube
vehicle to get battery

27
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,030
gonna hook up I'll are positive cable

28
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:11,600
we're going to use the red color coat
fast

29
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,869
it again good clamp on our positive
cable here

30
00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:20,280
and then on our negative cable here

31
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,920
at this point RK before class or wanna
make sure

32
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,030
that we don't touch it and we come to
the vehicle with a dead battery what's

33
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,149
gonna happen is

34
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:33,360
when you make this connection it'll
generate spark

35
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,000
that's why Warner spark a way for the
battery so wanna start here

36
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,349
but the positive sad pick up here

37
00:00:41,349 --> 00:00:46,489
and they want to find a good point
somewhere away from the battery

38
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:51,510
of its metal own give us a good ground
%uh

39
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,720
the other thing you need to be aware of
is where the belt is where the police

40
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,739
are going to be turning I you don't want
to create

41
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:01,239
a and interference with your cables and
the running vehicle

42
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:04,780
so this point okay was a fucked up got

43
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,400
the battery it up on the on a good
vehicle got positive cable on the dead

44
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,040
battery

45
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,239
and a good gramm point away from the
battery now will start are

46
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:20,800
dollar for car make sure the make sure
that all make sense

47
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,500
part of the battery homemade dedicated
charged up for

48
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,400
really did you let me what's right for
me

49
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:47,200
lol charge the battery from the All Nite

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,480
they had a camera SK like I do it exact
same for the first quarter

51
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,940
get our ground cable of disconnect are
back a positive

52
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:03,700
the dead battery make sure we keep them
separate
