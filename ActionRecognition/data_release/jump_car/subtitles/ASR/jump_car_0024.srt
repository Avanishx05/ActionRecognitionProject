7
00:00:01,699 --> 00:00:09,030
the red and black, other end of these cables
to the car that has the good battery. The

8
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,729
red usually goes on the positive side of the
battery, the black usually goes on the negative

9
00:00:14,729 --> 00:00:23,420
side of the battery. And we're going to hook
these two ends up to this battery to jump

10
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:32,789
start it the same way. You never cross the
wires, you always put red to positive and

11
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:44,579
black to negative. There are exceptions, those
exceptions would be mentioned in your manual.

12
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,140
In this case, we're going to hook the red
up first, we always hook the red up and then

13
00:00:49,140 --> 00:01:00,369
the black, it eliminates the possibility of
having an explosion. Best situation is that

14
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:12,539
this battery is not too dead and we just hook
the two batteries together from the two cars

15
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:20,310
and his car just starts right up. Now in the
case where this battery is a little bit deader

16
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:26,920
than that, I might have to start my car, let
it run for a little while to charge this battery

17
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,920
up a little bit, and then have him try and
start his car. If the battery is worse than

18
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,610
that, we may have to pull the battery out
and take it some place and have it charged

19
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:47,230
and then put it back in. But the best protection
for your car, being the car that's jumping

20
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:53,540
the other car, is to leave your car turned
off so you don't run the risk of damaging

21
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,819
your alternator. In this situation, I'm just
going to hook the two batteries together which

22
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:07,459
I've already done and he's going to try to
start his car. My car is not running. And

23
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:14,439
his car started right up. So now we need to
disconnect it from the car once it starts,

24
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:18,489
you disconnect it just the opposite of the
way that you connected it. You disconnect

25
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:26,170
the negative first, the black in this case,
and then you disconnect the red and then you

26
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,640
do the same thing to the other car.
