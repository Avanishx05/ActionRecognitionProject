9
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,060
next position the vehicle's next to each
other then

10
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,540
open the hood and find where the
batteries are half you find the

11
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,260
batteries

12
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,260
look for a black or red

13
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,770
on the battery black is minus red

14
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,210
is a plus if they're is in a black or
red for a minus symbol

15
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,590
or a plus symbol to determine which
terminal with

16
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,850
the most important thing to remember
what jump starting your vehicle

17
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,409
is to not let the jumper cable and touch
each other first

18
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:36,870
hope the positive jumper cable and first

19
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:44,790
laying -1 to the side

20
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,950
then

21
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,030
but the negative jumper cable and to the
negative terminal

22
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:54,020
%uh

23
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,020
when she had jumper cables for to the
batteries

24
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:07,539
then want to start the working vehicle
and let him run

25
00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:14,420
after that price starting vehicle with a
dead battery

26
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,729
it still wont start let the working
vehicle run for a few more minutes

27
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:23,950
right here once you get the vehicle with
the dead battery started

28
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:28,479
disconnect the jumper cables by removing
the negative and first
