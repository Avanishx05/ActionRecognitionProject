7
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:05,670
jump-started powers not difficult but
can be dangerous if not done properly

8
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,330
it's really important you follow the
right procedure just a sec Park the cast

9
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,440
in a safe place

10
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,400
and make sure that the not touching nice
to nyse: what's best

11
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,519
as jumper cables and not very long check
the fight Catherine cock on your child

12
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:23,930
and that the hand brakes are on then
switch off the engine at the diner power

13
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,190
open the bonnet a page cannot unlike at
the batteries

14
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:31,059
make sure that by factors a 12 volts if
you're not sure

15
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:34,659
don't attempt to jump-start the guy is
self the batteries have a positive

16
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,589
terminal and negative terminal

17
00:00:36,589 --> 00:00:39,960
the positive terminal is red with a
positive symbol

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,000
and the negative terminal is black with
a negative symbol

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,360
you can see these in 98 what why some
other right Ron and battery acid but the

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,790
clock now back to yes it's pretty nasty
stuff so avoid getting it on your

21
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:57,940
and throw away the cost right away first
connect the red jumper late to the

22
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,220
positive return 0

23
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,950
at the flat battery and then attach the
clip on the other end delayed

24
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,720
to the positive rate terminal at the
diner battery then connect the black

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,880
jumper late to the negative black
terminal at the diner vehicle

26
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,330
before attaching the free into the cable
to a solid metal past but the cop with a

27
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,170
flat battery

28
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:19,820
such as the top suspension mount don't
connect the cable to any moving past

29
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,460
ensure that the cables a will clear the
exhaust or drive belts

30
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,930
an easy way to remember what color goes
where is to think afraid

31
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,330
as a bright happy positive color and
black is a negative kala

32
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,100
stop the engine at the diner vehicle and
let it run for a few minutes

33
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:34,900
about you

34
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,840
thousand brits a minute then stop the
engine at the people with the flat

35
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,420
battery

36
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,050
allow the engine to fast auto from in a
minute two minutes before disconnecting

37
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,060
the jump relates

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,200
now carefully remove the jumper late in
the reverse order to the connection
