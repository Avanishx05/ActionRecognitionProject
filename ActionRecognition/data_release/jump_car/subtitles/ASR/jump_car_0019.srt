43
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,939
goods of vehicles open so

44
00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:06,999
like I said we're gonna pretend that my
the coat is the gum that the dead

45
00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:07,709
vehicle sorry

46
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:12,639
so now this just for demonstration
purposes but noticeable

47
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,439
batteries are on the driver side so this
actually technically won't work

48
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:21,180
but I don't feel like putting them into
and alright step 1: make sure your

49
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,599
vehicle is not running

50
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:26,109
either vehicle why pretty obvious

51
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:29,930
first step we use we're gonna start with
our jumper vehicle

52
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,779
we do not want the vehicle to be running
your life K

53
00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:37,319
be positive and a jumper cable and
attach

54
00:00:37,319 --> 00:00:41,590
choot ke good battery out right now
we're just gonna leave the negative and

55
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,019
alone

56
00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:46,559
okay so now the next step is resuming

57
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,769
accumulate all green fuzz after I
cleaned it but anyway

58
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:52,840
the cake a positive lead on the other
end

59
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,379
and we attach the vehicles dead battery

60
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:59,379
now on to me get battery

61
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:06,379
we attach the negative cable make sure
these are securely fastened now in the

62
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:07,799
vehicle the dead battery

63
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,989
not want to hook this up to the negative
cable cuz if we do

64
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:16,769
for this crap on it may spark and
sparking hydrogen means boom

65
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:21,019
so we want is like her hair look and
there's plenty a metal on the engine

66
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:24,779
to rate here's a nice thick piece a
medal here

67
00:01:24,779 --> 00:01:28,519
gonna move back and forth a little they
get a good connection

68
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:31,689
so we always run aground the

69
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:34,949
negative cable on the dead battery to a
good

70
00:01:34,949 --> 00:01:39,900
solid engine ground force our body
ground some sort every down the exhaust

71
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,269
manifold way down there or up on top of
the engine but has to be something good

72
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,409
and solid metal

73
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:47,560
case in our guy come and start whose

74
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,650
jumper hit for and now we come over and
we start the vehicle

75
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:58,930
the dead battery the the

76
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,890
the
