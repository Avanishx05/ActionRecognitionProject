26
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,350
the first thing that you want to do is
bring a good car

27
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:11,659
up to your dead car and leave enough
space so that you can work around in it

28
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:15,159
there is a specific order that you wanna
connect these cables and to prevent

29
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:16,380
sparking and

30
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,759
shorting out of the cables so step one
is you going to connect wanna be read

31
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:21,259
Anza

32
00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:25,450
one of the cables to the positive post
the dead battery

33
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:36,380
so here you can see it's already
connected

34
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,770
now you're going to move on to Step 2

35
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,050
which is you're going to connect the
other end of that red cable to the

36
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,220
positive post

37
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:48,970
be good battery

38
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,130
and while you're still there step three
is going to connect the

39
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:56,170
first black end of the cable onto the
negative post

40
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:04,240
above the good battery and back here on
the dead car you're going to connect the

41
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,490
other end of that black cable onto a
shiny metal part of the

42
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,610
engine block or on the middle chassis
don't connected to the battery post

43
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,360
because we want to prevent any possible
explosions or sparks

44
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,090
and here's another example here we found
a nice shiny ball sticking out to the

45
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:19,710
chassis

46
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,519
any of these will work

47
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,780
as a sanity check that you connected the
cables right you don't like should come

48
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,940
on on the dead car

49
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,650
so now let's start powering down
everything on both cars make sure that

50
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,940
all the lights are off on both cars

51
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,849
you want to unplug all of your power
port solve your cigarette lighter

52
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:39,890
adaptors

53
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:45,159
I'm

54
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:48,870
turn off your car radios on both
vehicles

55
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,209
if you have your air conditioner running
you wanna turn off your air conditioner

56
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:53,989
as well

57
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:59,489
I'm any radar detectors make sure those
are unplugged

58
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:03,810
and basically any device should be
unplugged including your iPods

59
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,650
start the engine on a good car and run
it for five minutes to charge the

60
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,989
battery on the dead car

61
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:18,530
C

62
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,459
I like to try method number one first
what we do is we try to charge the dead

63
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,129
car's battery 1st

64
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:29,250
and then return of the good car and see
if the decker will start on its own

65
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,209
specific this method to protect the
electrical system

66
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:36,069
starting vehicle

67
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:39,630
so if this fails i'd entrust starting
method number two

68
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,630
where you try to start the dead car with
the good cars engine running to give it

69
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,670
more power boost

70
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,419
now that you're dead car has been
resurrected you can't disconnect all the

71
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,169
cables
