17
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,400
okay step 1: this is a car with a dead
battery and this is that I was a

18
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:04,949
professional

19
00:00:04,949 --> 00:00:07,769
you need to pack them as close together
as you can but without him touching

20
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:09,190
because I could cause a spark

21
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:15,360
turn ignition of in both cars first of
the move the battery cover

22
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,470
and you're looking for the positive term
in office is usually marks

23
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,910
read like this when they all have a
little plus sign me connect the

24
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,960
read John played to the positive battery
terminal on the desktop

25
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,840
step 2 connect the other end up the read
complete to the positive

26
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,670
terminal on the good cup on this car the
positive terminal isn't

27
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,830
colored red but it does have a a close
sign here sorry

28
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,100
we know that's the right one step 3:
connect the black complete

29
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,860
to the negative terminal on the donut
set for

30
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,800
connect the other end to the black
complete to Center of the Earth point

31
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,540
on the dadka

32
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,930
step by leave a jumper cables connected
for about three minutes

33
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,270
the backing both can equalize make sure
that's the cables a

34
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,290
move when away from anything moving in
the engine as well

35
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,270
and make sure you remove the back cover
at the engine compartment

36
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,060
step 6: started at a Cairo to run for a
minute

37
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,600
then what is still running start the
dead car and lead both running for about

38
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,420
10 minutes

39
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,680
don't remove jump leads personal cars
engines are running

40
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,700
step 7 turn the ignition both kinds of

41
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,990
and remove the comp in the reverse order
that you put them on
