cables

20
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:06,509
keeping them separate from each other
both and that your cable

21
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,880
here and gonna go on posited

22
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,149
lifetimes you're mad real have a little
plus mark on it

23
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:18,200
which indicates positive Armie Hammer
red

24
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,530
cable terminal which indicates fun and
then you have your black

25
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,740
goes on negative as you can see there's
a negative

26
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,840
sign their and a black people as well on
matters like

27
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,190
make sure you keep him hired cable
separate from each other so they don't

28
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,630
sparred

29
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,580
which can be here problem anyhow so
that's how we're hooking up our

30
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,160
batteries and keeping everything

31
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,349
themes everything red and black cock

32
00:00:47,349 --> 00:00:50,870
pp

33
00:00:50,870 --> 00:01:07,120
separated them

34
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,620
you things

35
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:21,920
world

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,060
so notice again this is a different
style a battery

37
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,819
at that what we call a top post are
other vehicle at inside pulse but again

38
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:31,099
you see a plus mark

39
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:34,170
you see red here if you

40
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,890
come across a vehicle hanging you're
just not sure

41
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,959
negative your and positive post are two
different signs

42
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,650
the positive polls in a bit larger the
round post here

43
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,300
and the negativism well that's smaller
than the part that so that's another way

44
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,799
you can identify positive and negative
on a battery

45
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,370
group again keeping our gable separate

00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,459
windblown you up but it definitely
because the problem

50
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:20,580
nothing in the reason why I don't hang
