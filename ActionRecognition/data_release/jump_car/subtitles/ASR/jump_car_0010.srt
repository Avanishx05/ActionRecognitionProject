22
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,729
started

23
00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:05,060
Park both cars in mutual next to each
other so the close but not such an

24
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,210
and put the ham break some you don't
want to roll away

25
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,590
next should pop open both car bonnets
and secured them

26
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,920
than check that the jump leads can reach
from one car but she to the other

27
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,729
stunned over by the car with a good
battery

28
00:00:18,729 --> 00:00:22,780
the red gym late is the past late so
find the positive terminal

29
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,149
on the work in bad shape now this should
have some kind of Lost Symbol

30
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:30,259
all with a red cap all red markings
connect to this terminal using the click

31
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:31,659
the end the read complete

32
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:35,210
check in at the teeth gripped the
terminal properly than go back to the

33
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,530
car with the flat battery and cannot be
other end

34
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,229
this red completed the positive terminal
on the flat battery you don't need to

35
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:44,329
switch back to the car with a good
battery

36
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:48,350
pick up the block complete and connect
it to the negative terminal which should

37
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,719
how to minus symbol

38
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:53,490
or a black cap now this is the tricky
bit to remember

39
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,009
with the other end to the buck to meet
move back to the car with a dead battery

40
00:00:57,009 --> 00:01:01,140
invest time instead of connecting it to
the negative terminal you need to find a

41
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,460
solid piece of metal

42
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,040
on the engine like a bomb or a bracket
double-checking that its

43
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,530
firmly attached this earthing point has
to be away from the fuel system

44
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,600
on battery and some cause even have a
specific anything but for this purpose

45
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,060
to humble to find out if yours does and
I should be all foreign to the John Lee

46
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,220
is properly connected

47
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,910
now once all the gently the hopes up way
a few minutes for the voltages to

48
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:25,880
equalize

49
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,730
I want you waited a bit you'll then need
to start the engine of the healthy car

50
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,760
and let it run for minority leave this
engine running and then try and start

51
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,750
the engine at the college had but
battery

52
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,460
if it doesn't work way a bit longer with
the engine to be %uh the car still

53
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,600
running before trying to start the
engine again

54
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,430
the engine does start then leave both
cars running for its hand

55
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,750
minutes now you know is the jump leads
are getting a bit hot then you need to

56
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,200
tell me engines office let them cool
down a bit

57
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,680
after 10 minutes ago the next step is to
turn off both the car engines

58
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,780
than in reverse order you need to
Kathleen remove

59
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,480
me to the jump leads be really cattle
not to touch the clips against each

60
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:03,850
other

61
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,580
all make contact with any all the metal
such as the car's bodywork

62
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,370
otherwise you cause a bit of a band stop
by Kathleen clicking the black

63
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,800
complete from near pinpoint than on
click the other negative and at the same

64
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,510
lead

65
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,160
do the same with the read complete and
flipping it from the positive terminals

66
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,190
at the donor car
