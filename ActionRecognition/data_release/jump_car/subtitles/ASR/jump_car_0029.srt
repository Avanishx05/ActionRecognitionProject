battery 1st

9
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,510

00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,300
to the positive post on the vehicle with
the

11
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,129
better step to go over to the vehicle
with a good battery

12
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:18,309
and though we want to make the
connection on the positive terminal

13
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:22,210
knows that there's a plastic cover here
some batteries have that make sure you

14
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,320
are un clip it folded all the way

straight to a chess the Grail

22
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,579
so that the spark does not ignite

23
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,590
