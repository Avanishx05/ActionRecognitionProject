18
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,810
vehicle very important knowledge she
never does 20 damage daddy

19
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,590
hanks

20
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,800
your first let's get another year of the
working battery

21
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,650
important message others to the barriers
are near each other she can reach them

22
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,750
with jumper cables

23
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,660
the next step is to use of a nice show
jumper cables you could probably just

24
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,680
the vehicles

25
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,730
you've got the red positive side to the
dead battery

26
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,760
did you do the red positive side on the
good battery then you do the black

27
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,410
a negative on the good battery then

28
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,000
you take the black I for the dead
battery and he got the some kind of

29
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,110
ground on the engine Detmer won

30
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,160
its best foot off the ground is valid
for a better response was he don't love

31
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:52,400
the circuit

32
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,310
first fresh start they do not like this
sometimes

33
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,550
it's not that bad it will still be able
to finish the like this

34
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,270
that does work start to live with the
battery and let the church he dead

35
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,970
battery for a few minutes before you
start

36
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:08,370
dash to them green

37
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,850
I think I have a Coast Guard you i'll
arrive allow the charge up the dead

38
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,070
battery before coming to start the other
guy

39
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,090
on for

40
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,420
for

41
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,020
the only thing the cables you doing here
were scored a hit with the muffin

42
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,160
he sure you can not to touch the table
and together
