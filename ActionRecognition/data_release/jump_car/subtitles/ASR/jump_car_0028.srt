13
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,620
this is our

14
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,180
donor car it's important to get them
parked beside each other but make sure

15
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,640
they're not touching and ensure that
ignition is off both cars

16
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,410
so depending on your car make and model
there might be color identifiers

17
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,370
to indicate whether it's the positive or
negative terminal of the battery

18
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:23,370
to go to connect the red cable to the
positive terminal of the dead car

19
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,860
and then you're going to connect the
opposite end up the red cable

20
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,930
to the positive terminal on the donor
card

21
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,590
Sonex I'm gonna place the black cable

22
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,979
on the negative terminal up the donor
card and lastly I'm gonna place the

23
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:39,530
other end up the black cable

24
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,229
on an unpainted acted point on the dead
car

25
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:47,630
now once you have the cables connected
to both cars leave it for about three

26
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,700
minutes that hello

27
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,789
devoted to the battery see equalized
between the cars

28
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:55,340
in that time it's a good idea just to
make sure that the cables are

29
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:00,270
outside the engine bay and not near any
the moving parts after the three minutes

30
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:06,110
start the engine of the donor card lead
at lunch foreign minister for sacking

31
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,720
get to start the engine up the dead car

32
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,720
I want sided let's hope I

33
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,130
million ten-minute so after the 10
minutes make sure you turn off the

34
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,760
ignition in both cars before removing
the clip

35
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,080
eclipse will be removed in the reverse
order that they were placed initially

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,970
so firstly remove the black cable from
the earth point on the date card next

37
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,740
we're gonna remove the other and the
black cable from

38
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,080
the donor car so third on going to
remove the red cable

39
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,570
from the donor card and finally I'm
gonna remove the red cable from the dead

40
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:42,910
pack

41
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,739
with the cables are removed from the car
you can start the engine in your dead

42
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:47,209
car
