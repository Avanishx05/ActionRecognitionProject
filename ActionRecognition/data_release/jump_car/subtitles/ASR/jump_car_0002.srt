17
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,340
on both cars barry on one side battery
on the other side

18
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,040
a should be a problem because the cables
will be long enough

19
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:24,570
this is the good car

20
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,840
I'm going to start with the good car and

21
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,060
always start by putting on the
positively first

22
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,570
hear something real-life love if these
are laying on the ground and they're

23
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,180
touching

24
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,890
my little incident earlier was because I
had it hooked up to a battery that has

25
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,380
to do things together

26
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,660
you know what these touching so you want
to look these up

27
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,030
one at a time so that both are not
hooked up to one car

28
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:53,000
and then your got these other two laying
on the ground that could potentially

29
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,530
arc in touch so you start with the
positive battery cable

30
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:02,380
just give it a little wiggle

31
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,700
when he put it on that way that teeth
from the jumper cables or by 10

32
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,280
a little bit can make a better
connection okay which one positive in

33
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,239
which ones negative

34
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:14,640
very good question I on top of the
battery

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,160
we'll see a lot of times

36
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,050
is a plus sign for positive and a minus
sign for negative

37
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,060
the positive cable will have like
something read-only

38
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,320
think this was read

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,470
and then a negative cable is usually
black

40
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,780
puts a case like this you don't know

41
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,580
you don't see a plus sign your negative
sign is kinda hidden

42
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,720
the negative cable usually runs

43
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,250
someplace that touches the body
somewhere you know this is some place on

44
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:46,860
the body

45
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,140
or someplace on the engine the positive
cable always goes to

46
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,940
starter which is that guy so what you
can do if you don't know which is which

47
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,630
as you can follow the cables and

48
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,530
the one that has anything that goes to
like the body in the car

49
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,209
or the outside the engine that's the one
that's going to be negative

50
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:09,230
and of course the other was gonna be
positive if you can follow the negative

51
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,790
cable for the positive cable

52
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,859
kid now I'm gonna go to the dead car pin
connector

53
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:24,000
positive better came once again make
sure that this

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,650
the studio not touch next we're going to
hook

55
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,880
the negative cable up on the good car
you go

56
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,959
now here's the tricky part my know
what's coming next

57
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,280
you might not don't hook the negative

58
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,060
jumper cable up to the battery on the
car the trying to jump

59
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,470
a much better way to do this is to find
a good ground

60
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,299
on the engine itself in other words find
a shiny metal spot on the engine

61
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:54,359
that you know is nice solid metal and
hit the ground cable up there

62
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:58,620
not to the battery itself K usually like
to look for is like a big hooks sticking

63
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,940
up of the top the engine something like
that

64
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,519
this would be the engine this is where
you would like

65
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,570
to have it mounted the alternator

66
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,720
isn't axle a place to put a cable

67
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,970
if you got it off so how bout rate here

68
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,520
part of the alternator or put that

69
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,900
you wanna make sure to keep it away from
any the spinning stuff

70
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,000
k cables are all hooked up from the good
car the battery

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,290
in a bad car and the battery and a good

72
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:35,810
engine ground now let's start a good car
for the

73
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,080
let the good car run for a little while
the more you intend to start the other

74
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,550
car

75
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,360
the battery time to

76
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,220
to charge up a little bit we'll actually
turning he and try to start the other me

77
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,240
in the other car is not starting

78
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,289
Mearns be really really dead which might
want to do it you might want to raise

79
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:54,130
the I love when the car then

80
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,530
is a good car and let it run into higher
I'll that will

81
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,919
allow the alternator to work a little
bit better in charge battery up

82
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:05,180
even more that it would just by sitting
idle alright now I'm gonna go with the

83
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:05,949
dead car

84
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:09,550
been running for a little while tried
started please please please don't

85
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,259
believe

86
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:17,200
like

87
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,390
day finally both cars running disconnect
the cables

88
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,870
on both cars the sooner the better your
early Mon

89
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,980
too long tight you want to start with
taking ground cable

90
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,200
of for T

91
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:39,249
low
