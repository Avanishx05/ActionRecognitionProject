16
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,420
not touching both turned off in park

17
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:12,350
and on a flat surface that the Safeway
to begin the process of getting your

18
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,119
battery

21
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,920
the jumper cables notice

22
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,770
that the red cables are for the positive
connections

23
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,930
and the black handled cables are for the
negative connections look at your

24
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,780
batteries very closely

25
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,729
very easy to find the positive in
negative cables

26
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:42,979
it's either going to be marked on the
battery or with some batteries

27
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:46,540
the positive post is actually painted
read to make it easier

28
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,439
the for you to know that the positive
cable the black

29
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:53,460
or negative cable is

30
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,549
is easy really easy did to find as well

31
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:00,579
so let's begin let's connect first

32
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:04,710
to did didn't at dead car which is this
car

33
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,380
the dead car battery you start by
connecting the positive cable

34
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,600
to the positive chairman of on the dead
battery

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,700
then you connect the positive cable

36
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,739
to the positive post on your good
battery

37
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,690
next you're gonna connect the negative
cable to the

38
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:28,920
negative post on the good battery now
here's the most important thing and

39
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,420
where most people messed up

40
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,760
do not connect the negative cable

41
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,920
to the negative post you wanna fine
actually

42
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,230
a nice clean shiny Bowl are not inside
the engine compartment to connect it to

43
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,750
it's going to spark and that's normal
and we don't wanna

44
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,209
light a fire under battery so that's the
safest way to do it

45
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:53,650
so that's our connection now we're gonna
start the good car

46
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,980
and we're gonna let it run for a few
minutes

47
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,620
that's gonna charge up a little bit the
battery

48
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,920
on the dead car then we're gonna go
ahead and start

49
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,069
the dead car battery and it should
startup right away

50
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:12,769
congratulations you most likely were
able to start

51
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:17,849
the dead battery car however if you
weren't able to do it the first time

52
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:21,599
just let the two cars that connected for
a little while longer

53
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,650
and let that the dead battery charge a
little longer

54
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,769
and try again that should make you
successful

55
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:31,110
now we're going to remove our cables
we're gonna start

56
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,290
first bike breaking our connection by
removing

57
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,409
than negative cable from

58
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:41,670
our bowls then we're going to remove
than negative cable

59
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,040
from our good battery and then we're
going to remove our

60
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,940
positive cable from the dead battery
