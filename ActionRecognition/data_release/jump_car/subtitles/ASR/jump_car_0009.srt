14
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:16,399
connected to your positive terminal up
the dead battery

15
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,390
after connect the positive cable to the
positive terminal

16
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,930
love the dead battery you're going to
connect the positive cable

17
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,869
to the positive terminal the charge
battery you will then connect the

18
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:28,750
negative cable which is black

19
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,790
to the negative terminal up the charge
battery

20
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,909
and then you'll connect the negative
cable

21
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:38,340
to either your engine block or in this
case we can connect

23
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,270

00:00:54,289 --> 00:01:00,920
cable from the frame then you would take
the negative cable

27
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,470
from the charge battery then take the
