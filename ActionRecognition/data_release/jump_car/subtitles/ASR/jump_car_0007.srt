16
00:00:00,159 --> 00:00:03,869
sore start by connecting possible the
cable

17
00:00:03,869 --> 00:00:11,479
to the positive posed to the dead
battery they will connect

18
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:15,009
this positive then to the positive post
alive that up

19
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:21,460
now for the negative 20 connect negative
to negative

20
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,119
so take the black and the negative and
connect this

21
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,060
to the negative terminal on the live
better

22
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,640
and then the negative cable here

23
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,820
to the post on the dead there now as an
option

24
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,619
you can connect this the negative in

25
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,930
to either the engine block or the frame
to the car says it really that important

26
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:45,360
the

27
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,040
did the cables in that exact order
you're full of questions today aren't

28
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,130
you

29
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,399
actually you're asking great questions
it is important to connect positive to

30
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,070
positive

31
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,600
negative to negative cuz I batteries
current is designed to only flow in one

32
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,290
direction

33
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,939
that current is interrupted we could
have a battery explosion

34
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:08,599
I wouldn't want that and the reason we
can connect the negative into the cable

35
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:12,480
to the cars engine block or the frame on
the car the dead battery

36
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,060
is that this helps keep the positive and
negative cable separated

37
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,920
and maximize the chance affective
grounding we've got the car separated

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,760
think we're ready to start the car with
a live battery

39
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:32,140
jump car that saw me in

40
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,810
why do you have to start this car first
well that's a good question

41
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,450
by starting at the car with the light
that refers to creates

42
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,230
a more efficient flow of current in the
alternator at this car

43
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,390
is already recharging the battery here
so that the flow to the car the dead

44
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:47,870
battery

45
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,489
is going to be stronger that if we did
not have this current got

46
00:01:51,489 --> 00:02:01,340
okay I think array to start this one up
relax go ahead

47
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,860
now we've got the cables collected
properly in the live car running

48
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,950
leave let this situation set for just a
couple minutes

49
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,490
let the current flow from the good
battery into the bath

50
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:17,090
couple minutes should do it

51
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:35,100
done

52
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:43,600
the the

53
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,480
okay I think you're ready to start the
car

54
00:02:45,480 --> 00:03:04,349
with the dead that

55
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:08,659
okay we've got the car with a dead
battery started now we remove the cable

56
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:19,949
want to do that reverse order source RI
removing the negative

57
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:27,650
little under the positive cable

58
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,840
I make sure you're removing the cables
another illness touch

59
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,850
like a result in a spark maybe even a
fire
