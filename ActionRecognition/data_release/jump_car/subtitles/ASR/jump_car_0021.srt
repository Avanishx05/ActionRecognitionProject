3
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,730
it's a positive jump late I miss it fast
guy who

4
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,060
on the dyno vehicle I should connect to
the positive terminal

5
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,109
you can mail Catholic type this I the
hon connect this to the positive

6
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:12,010
terminal

7
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,359
of the catch up to the vehicle next is
the negative and again

8
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:19,560
the first connection we might be so the
negative terminal of their

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,160
found a vehicle I'm being very careful
with the negative come played

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,050
this meets the guy who on unearthing
point on the call now this combi

11
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,270
acclaimed metal on the engine or claim
to metal on the chassis

12
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,510
but it doesn't want to go directly onto
the battery itself

13
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,870
when you connect and they're also
consider and be careful you don't

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,020
connect it to

15
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,820
near the back tree or any fuel
compartments on the call

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,270
so there's a nice claimed and that okay
we could connect

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,239
a nest right onto the battery now buyers
late to connect it

18
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,250
we need to white at least three minutes
for the pulpits the side lost between

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,010
calls

20
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,780
now but the lead to being connected and
left for a few minutes

21
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,259
week announced all the time the vehicle
we should lead to find a vehicle running

22
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:09,270
for a few minutes and then stop a
casualty vehicle

23
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,710
we should leave them by priming

24
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,900
for about 15 minutes select the battery
voltages equalize

25
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,590
if during that fifty minutes the late
start getting warm

26
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:25,150
cocaine haul the shit ton of bicycles
I'm disconnect the lates

27
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,030
yepp don't disconnect the late while the
vehicles running

28
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:34,290
that this can cause serious damage to
the call

29
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,909
so we start with the negative terminal
which is placed on the engine

30
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:42,270
of the casualty vehicle and we
disconnect that being careful

31
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:48,650
I'm disconnected from that are difficult
once disconnected the negative we

32
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,180
commend move on to the positive

33
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,960
and again be careful when you disconnect
them not to talk to network
