10
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,990
line up the hood of the working car as
close as possible to the one with the dead

11
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:06,630
battery

12
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,790
but make sure they're not touching. next

13
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,610
turn off both cars and put them on park. also turn
off and unplug

14
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,350
anything in either car that runs on the
battery like headlamp

15
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,910
radio air conditioning and everything
plugged into the power outlet

16
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,390
like mp3 players or cellphones. okay

17
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,560
best really important.

18
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,860
if either battery is cracked or leaking do not
attach the jumper cables to it.

19
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,979
the battery could explode and spray acid all over you.

20
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:42,280
not pretty. now locate the positive and
negative terminals

21
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,890
to the batteries. conveniently enough every
battery is labeled.

22
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,910
so you shouldn't have too much trouble
determining which is which.

23
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,350
if you don't see the markings it's
probably because the battery terminals

24
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,330
are dirty.

25
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:59,950
just wipe off any corrosion or battery
acid near the terminals

26
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,860
with a rag. now

27
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,740
you're ready to connect the cables.

28
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,330
here is an easy way to remember how to
connect them. you're looking for a

29
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,100
positive outcome to the situation.

30
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,909
so you want the highest number
of positive connections possible.

31
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:17,270
as for the cable themselves the positive
cable

32
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,460
is usually red and the negative cable is
usually black. but

33
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,399
not all jumper cables are color-coded the
same way. so read the instructions that

34
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:29,119
came with them before you start. attach
the positive cable

35
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,620
to the positive battery terminal in the
car with a dead battery first.

36
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,090
then connect the other end of the
positive cable

37
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,300
to the positive battery terminal on the
working car.

38
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,470
next connect the negative cable to the
negative battery terminal

39
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,240
of the working car.

40
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,570
then find a solid metal part on the
engine

41
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,280
on the dead car to attach the other end
of the negative cable to. make sure it's

42
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,520
not a part of the battery

43
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,400
and that it isn't painted.

44
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,980
it should be a clean shiny metal like
a nut on the engine block.

45
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,440
if it is dirty or oily clean it up first.

46
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,930
when you connect the negative cable don't worry if there's a spark.
it is

47
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:12,530
normal. just think of it as a replacement
for your morning coffee.

48
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:17,200
now that the cables are set up

49
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,120
you're ready to start jumping. first turn
on the good cars engine

50
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,650
and let it run for a minute or two
before you try to start the dead battery.

51
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,990
if you wanna check that you have the
cable setup correctly

52
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:33,100
turn on the dome light in the dead car. if
it comes on

53
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,350
the cable are right. now you can try
turning on the dead car.

54
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,340
if the engine sounds like it is trying to
crank but won't turn over completely

55
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,640
give it a few more minutes and then rev
the engine a bit

56
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,690
on the good car. once the engine in the
dead car turns over

57
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,959
you can remove the cables. be sure to
leave the engine running though.

58
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,060
it takes a while for the battery to
fully recharge.

59
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,810
when you remove the cables be careful
not to let the clamps touch each other

60
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,840
or you could be in for quite a shock.
disconnect the cables in the opposite order than you connected them in.
