12
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,079
We're going to connect one end of the red jumper cable to the
positive terminal on the stalled

13
00:00:04,079 --> 00:00:09,079
battery. red on dead. Now we're going to move up to the good
battery and connect the other red

14
00:00:09,079 --> 00:00:12,890
cable clamp to the positive terminal on
the good battery. now it's time to

15
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,680
move on to the black jumper cable clamps.

16
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,850
we are staying on the good battery. the jumper
car.

17
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,369
as you want to connect one end of the black
jumper cable to the negative terminal

18
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:25,590
on the good battery. now you might be tempted
to just connect

19
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,770
the black jumper cable to the negative
terminal on the dead battery

20
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:33,220
but most experts agree to not do this.
there's a chance you could cause a spark and an

21
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,259
explosion.

22
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:38,189
probably won't happen but better safe
than sorry. so what we want to do instead is

23
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:42,100
is connect the other black cable
to a clean unpainted metal surface under

24
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,790
the disabled car's hood.

25
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,710
the car's engine block is a good place or
somewhere along the frame

26
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,810
the car which is what I did. now what
you wanna do now is

27
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,960
start the car that's doing the jumping and
allow it to run for 2-3 minutes before

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,310
starting the dead car.

29
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,460
basically charging up the dead car's
battery. and now

30
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,520
turn the ignition on the dead car and
the car should start. well done.

31
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,130
you jump started a car. now what we need
to do is remove the cables in reverse

32
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:11,750
order

33
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,600
of how we connected them. so we start of with
the black cable

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,610
on the former dead battery's car. remove it
from that piece of metal

35
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,939
that you clamped it to. then we move back over to
the jumping car.

36
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:25,629
remove the black cable from the negative
terminal on the good battery.

37
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:30,140
we go to the Red cable on the good car.
remove that from that positive terminal.

38
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,180
go back to our formerly dead car and remove the red jumper cable from that positive terminal.
