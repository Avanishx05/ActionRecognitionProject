26
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,280
you are gonna start with your good vehicle. the vehicle with the good battery.

27
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,030
we're gonna hook up our positive cable.

28
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:11,600
we're going to use the red color code
sor positive.

29
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,869
get a good clamp on our positive
cable here

30
00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:20,280
and then on our negative cable here.

31
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,920
now at this point our cables are live. so we wanna
make sure

32
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,030
that we don't touch it. when you come to
the vehicle with the dead battery what's

33
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,149
gonna happen is

34
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:33,360
when you make this connection it'll
generate spark.

35
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,000
that's why we wanna keep the spark away from the
battery. so we wanna start here

36
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,349
the positive side hook up here.

37
00:00:41,349 --> 00:00:46,489
then we want to find a good point
somewhere away from the battery

38
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:51,510
that's metal and will give us a good ground.

39
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,720
the other thing you need to be aware of
is where the belt is where the pulleys

40
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,739
are going to be turning. you don't want
to create

41
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:01,239
an interference with your cables and
the running vehicle.

42
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:04,780
so at this point okayour cables are hooked up. we got

43
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,400
the battery hooked up on the good
vehicle. we got positive cable on the dead

44
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,040
battery

45
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,239
and a good ground point away from the
battery. now we're gonna start our

46
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:20,800
donor car. make sure that all the accessories are turned off

47
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,500
so that the battery and the alternator can be dedicated
to charging up the new car.

48
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,400
if it's really dead you can let the vehicles run for a minute.

49
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:47,200
that'll help charge the vehicle battery from the alternator.

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,480
there you have it. now when you disconnect you want to do it in the exact reverse order.

51
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,940
we get our ground cable off. disconnect our
positive

52
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:03,700
from the dead battery. make sure we keep those
separated. then we disconnect our good vehicle.
