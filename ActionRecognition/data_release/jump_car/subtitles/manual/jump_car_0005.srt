00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:04,579
To properly jump start your car, the first
thing you want to do is park the

9
00:00:04,579 --> 00:00:07,710
working vehicle close to the one that needs
to be jumped, but don't let

10
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:13,210
them touch. Next, shut off the ignition on
both cars. Be sure to turn off

11
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,649
your lights, radio, and anything else that
can drain power.

12
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:20,800
To connect the jumper cables, connect the
red positive clamp to the dead

13
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,269
battery's positive post. You'll see a plus
on the battery. Connect the

14
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:31,170
other red clamp to the good battery. Make
sure the cables don't dangle into

15
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,839
either engine compartment, where they can
get tangled onto moving parts.

16
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:38,350
Now, connect the black negative clamp to the
working vehicle's negative

17
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:44,020
battery terminal. Once set, connect the other
negative cable to any

18
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,050
unpainted metal surface on the engine of the
dead car. Do a final check to

19
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,950
make sure the cables are set and not near
any moving engine parts.

20
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:59,290
Now, start the working car. Let it idle a
few minutes to feed juice to the

21
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:04,290
dead battery. When you think it's got enough
charge, start the dead vehicle

22
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,860
and let them idle together. Once the dead
car is running smoothly,

23
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:14,000
disconnect the cables in reverse order. Be
careful not to let the dangling
