00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,770
your typical jumper cables will come with two red clamps

10
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,090
and two black clamps. identify the
battery posts on both batteries.

11
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,010
positive will have anything red
associated with it. the red

12
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:17,040
cover the red clamps the little positive
symbol right there.

13
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,470
on the negative side you'll have black
cables

14
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,680
and a little negative symbol right
there.

15
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,010
sometimes it's very difficult to find
any coloring or any symbol.

16
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,190
one trick is to look at the size of the post.
the positive is going to be much larger

17
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,250
in diameter

18
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,560
than the negative post. it's best to know
which is which

19
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:41,600
because if you hook them up backwards you can
have serious electrical problems.

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,110
worse still as your battery discharges it
starts to emit a hydrogen gas.

21
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:54,490
mix that with spark and boom.

22
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,960
you get what I'm sayin. now you attach
the two red clamps.

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,190
it doesn't really matter what order
because you're not getting a final

24
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:02,930
contact.

25
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,770
notice i wiggle the clamps

26
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:12,050
to get better contact. without allowing the
black clamp touch any exposed metal

27
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,940
areas. good plastic bumper like this is
good. now you attach the black clamp

28
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,370
to the car that you're starting it with
on the negative post. for your final

29
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,020
connection

30
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,730
and this is the one that counts you wanna
find an exposed metal location on your

31
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,250
engine

32
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,190
and clamp it to it. now

33
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:37,450
electricity will flow from the live
battery to the dead battery. I recommend

34
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,250
you run the car with the live battery

35
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,250
to increase the flow of electricity. in
fact

36
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,440
you can rev the engine

37
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,469
for a faster flow of electricity.

38
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:57,150

39
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,220
now try to start it. if it doesn't start
right away

40
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,810
it's no problem. you'll just need to
spend more time waiting to charge that

41
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,530
dead

42
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:12,890
battery.

43
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:18,680


44
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,799
try starting it again.

45
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:25,209


46
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:28,260


47
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,690
your car is running now. pretty bad to leave the cables
dangling from the front of the car as

48
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,670
you drive down the road so I'd suggest you
disconnect the cables.

49
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,640
starting with the last one that you hooked up.
that's your negative

50
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,280
clamp. spark is just as important at this
time so make sure to let it go against

51
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,290
your plastic bumper.

52
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,680
from there you then disconnect the
cable on the car that started it followed by the two red cables.
