13
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,620
so this is our dead car and this is our

14
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,180
donor car. it's important to get them
parked beside each other but make sure

15
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,640
they're not touching and ensure that
ignition is off in both cars.

16
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,410
so depending on your car make and model
there might be color identifiers

17
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,370
to indicate whether it's the positive or the
negative terminal of the battery.

18
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:23,370
so you're going to connect the red cable to the
positive terminal of the dead car.

19
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,860
then you're going to connect the
opposite end of the red cable

20
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,930
to the positive terminal on the donor
car.

21
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,590
so next I'm gonna place the black cable

22
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,979
on the negative terminal of the donor
car. lastly I'm gonna place the

23
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:39,530
other end of the black cable

24
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,229
on an unpainted earthed point on the dead
car.

25
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:47,630
now once you have the cables connected
to both cars leave it for about three

26
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,700
minutes. that allows

27
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,789
the voltage of the batteries to equalize
between the cars.

28
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:55,340
in that time it's a good idea just to
make sure that the cables are

29
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:00,270
outside the engine bay and not near any
of the moving parts. after the three minutes

30
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:06,110
start the engine of the donor card and let
ir run for a few minutes before

31
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,720
starting the engine of the dead car.

32
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,720
so start the engine of the dead car.

33
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,130
once that's started let both cars run the engines for ten
minutes. make sure you turn off the

34
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,760
ignition in both cars before removing
the clips.

35
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,080
the clips will be removed in the reverse
order that they were placed initially.

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,970
so firstly remove the black cable from
the earthing point on the dead car. next

37
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,740
we're gonna remove the other end of the
black cable from

38
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,080
the donor car. so third I'm going to
remove the red cable

39
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,570
from the donor car and finally I'm
gonna remove the red cable from the dead

40
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:42,910
car.

41
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,739
once the cables are removed from the car
you can start the engine in your dead

42
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:47,209
car.
