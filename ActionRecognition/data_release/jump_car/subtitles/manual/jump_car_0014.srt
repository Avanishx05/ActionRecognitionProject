7
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:05,670
jump-starting a car is not difficult but
can be dangerous if not done properly.

8
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,330
it's really important you follow the
right procedure. just stay safe. Park the cars

9
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,440
in a safe place

10
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,400
and make sure that the not touching. nose to nose works best

11
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,519
as jumper cables are not very long. check
that both cars are in park or neutral

12
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:23,930
and that the hand brakes are on. then
switch off the engine of the donor car.

13
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,190
open the bonnet of each car and locate
the batteries.

14
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:31,059
make sure that both batteries are 12 volts. if
you're not sure

15
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:34,659
don't attempt to jump-start the car 
yourself. the batteries have a positive

16
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,589
terminal and a negative terminal.

17
00:00:36,589 --> 00:00:39,960
the positive terminal is red with a
positive symbol

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,000
and the negative terminal is black with
a negative symbol.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,360
if you can't see these you may need to wipe away some of the road grind and battery acid with a cloth.

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,790
now battery acid is pretty nasty
stuff so avoid getting it on you

21
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:57,940
and throw away the cloth right away. first
connect the red jumper lead to the

22
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,220
positive red terminal

23
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,950
at the flat battery and then attach the
clip on the other end of the lead

24
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,720
to the positive red terminal at the
donor battery. then connect the black

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,880
jumper lead to the negative black
terminal at the donor vehicle

26
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,330
before attaching the free end of the cable
to a solid metal part of the car with a

27
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,170
flat battery

28
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:19,820
such as the top suspension mount. don't
connect the cable to any moving part

29
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,460
and ensure that the cables are well clear of the
exhaust or drive belts.

30
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,930
an easy way to remember what color goes
where is to think of red

31
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,330
as a bright happy positive color and
black as a negative color.

32
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,100
start the engine of the donor vehicle and
let it run for a few minutes

33
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:34,900
at about 

34
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,840
two thousand revs a minute. then start the
engine of the car with the flat

35
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,420
battery.

36
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,050
allow the engine to fast idle for a minimum of
two minutes before disconnecting

37
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,060
the jumper leads. 

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,200
now carefully remove the jumper leads in
the reverse order to the connection starting with the one connected to the car body.
