13
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,120
you want to put the positive jumper
cable

14
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,040
on the dead battery. go over to
your car

15
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,880
with the good battery and put on your

16
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,559
positive cable here. then go
with your negative cable

17
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,989
on your good battery and then

18
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:25,420
well take your negative cable for the bad
battery and apply it to a ground.

19
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,930
the body of the vehicle or the engine.
something that is gonna be grounded

20
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,720
other than the battery terminal. at that
point you are gonna wanna start the car with the

21
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,269
good battery.

22
00:00:34,269 --> 00:00:38,260
rev it up a little bit and let it run for a few
minutes and then go ahead and give it a

23
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,530
crank on the bad battery side.

24
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:46,710


25
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,240
alright so we got the car with the good battery
running. Paul is gonna get in and rev it to about

26
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,009
2500 rpm. We are gonna let it sit like
that for

27
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:56,689
10-15 seconds. I am going to go to the
car with the faulty battery

28
00:00:56,689 --> 00:01:09,810
and crank it over.

29
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,080
right now I am go ahead and crank over
this car. 

30
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,240
so we got the car running. we are gonna reverse
the process

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,820
with the

32
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,020
jumper cables.

33
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,270
negative 

34
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,210
positive and positive.
