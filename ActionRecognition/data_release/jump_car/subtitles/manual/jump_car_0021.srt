3
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,730
the first connection is the positive jump lead. it should first go

4
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,060
on the donor vehicle. that should connect to
the positive terminal.

5
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,109
you can now carefully take this over and connect this to the positive

6
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:12,010
terminal

7
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,359
of the casuality vehicle. next is
the negative and again

8
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:19,560
the first connection we make is to the
negative terminal of the

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,160
donor vehicle. be very careful
with the negative jump lead.

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,050
this needs to go on an earthing
point on the car. now this could be

11
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,270
a clean bit of metal on the engine or a clean bit of metal on the chassis

12
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,510
but it doesn't want to go directly onto
the battery itself.

13
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,870
when you connecting it also
consider and be careful that you don't

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,020
connect it to

15
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,820
near the battery or any fuel
componentson the car.

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,270
so there's a nice clean bit of metal here that
we could connect

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,239
and then straight onto the battery. now those leads are connected

18
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,250
we need to wait at least three minutes
for the voltage to stabilise between

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,010
the cars.

20
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,780
now that the leads have been connected and
left for a few minutes

21
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,259
we can now start the donor vehicle.
we should leave the donor vehicle running

22
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:09,270
for a few minutes and then start the
casualty vehicle.

23
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,710
we should leave them both running

24
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,900
for about 15 minutes to let the battery
voltages equalize.

25
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,590
if during those fifteen minutes the leads
start getting warm

26
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:25,150
or start getting hot you should turn off both vehicles and disconnect the leads.

27
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,030
whatever you do don't disconnect the leads while the
vehicles are running

28
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:34,290
as this can cause serious damage to
the car.

29
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,909
so we start with the negative terminal
which is placed on the engine

30
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:42,270
of the casualty vehicle and we
disconnect that being careful

31
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:48,650
and disconnect it from the donor vehicle.
once disconnected the negative we

32
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,180
can then move on to the positive

33
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,960
and again be careful when you disconnect
them not to touch any metal work and disconnect the donor vehicle as well.
