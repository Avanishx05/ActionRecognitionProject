6
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:10,600
Ideally, that means hood to hood with a few
inches in between. Step 2. Turn off both engines.

7
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:16,660
Never light a match or smoke near a car battery.
The battery contains hydrogen, a highly explosive

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:23,460
gas. Step 3. Open the hoods of both cars.
Step 4. Identify the positive and negatives

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,880
terminals on both car batteries. They will
be labeled with a plus sign for positive and

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,470
minus sign for negative. Step 5. Connect one
of the red clamps on the jumper cables to

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:39,860
the positive terminal on the dead battery.
Step 6. Connect the other red clamp to the

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:47,359
positive terminal on the working car's battery.
Step 7. Connect the black clamp on the jumper

13
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:54,639
cables to the negative terminal on the working
car's battery. Step 8. Clip the remaining

14
00:00:54,639 --> 00:01:00,840
black clamp to a clean metal part of the dead
car's engine to ground the circuit. Step

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,249
9. Attempt to start the dead car. If it doesn't
start, disconnect the jumper cables in the

16
00:01:06,249 --> 00:01:11,229
reverse order: first the black clamps (starting
with the once-dead car), then the red clamps

17
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:19,969
(starting with the working car). Start the
engine of the working car and allow it to

18
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:25,859
run for about five minutes to boost its battery.
Step 10. Turn off the working car and again

19
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:29,840
attempt to jump the dead car by connecting
the cables in order and starting the
