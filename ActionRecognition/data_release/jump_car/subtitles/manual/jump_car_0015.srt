20
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,909
so on the car that's gonna be the booster you wanna connect the positive cable first.

21
00:00:05,909 --> 00:00:09,729
I put the

22
00:00:09,729 --> 00:00:22,340
negative on a plastic part so it doesn't
interfere.

23
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,540
okay and now on the car needs to be boosted
now you connect

24
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:34,030
the positive.

25
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:49,440
put this somewhere it is not touching anything
metal.

26
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,970
okay on the car

27
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,430
that's gonna be boosting the battery now
we connect the negative terminal.

28
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,610


29
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:04,920


30
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:13,150
nice solid connection.

31
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:17,069
okay the negative connection they say to
clamp it to

32
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:20,340
an unpainted part of the car.

33
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:31,220
that is pretty crazy. this car has
automatic start.

34
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,400
and it started automatically.

35
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:49,790
which was very weird. it started
automatically again.

36
00:01:49,790 --> 00:02:20,560
wow. that is strange. i'm going to get into the
car.

37
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,340


38
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,910
okay normally on the car that is gonna be

39
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,630
boosting the other car once it starts
for a while

40
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,340
you raise the RPM's to about

41
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,600
2000 RPM's.

42
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,639
that will charge the battery.

43
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,190
then you go to the other car

44
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,180
and just simply start the car. so you
are supposed to do this for five minutes depending

45
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,050
on how the depleted the battery is.

46
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:04,650
so let's go to the Acura.

47
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:16,910


48
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:33,590
now you wanna turn off all accessories.
radio is going to be a problem.

49
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:38,040
you've to enter the code.

50
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,790
now that the car has started you can unplug
the other battery.

51
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:48,410
so now you do everything in reverse order.
