16
00:00:00,159 --> 00:00:03,869
so we are gonna start by connecting the positive end of the
cable

17
00:00:03,869 --> 00:00:11,479
to the positive post of the dead
battery. then we will connect

18
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:15,009
this positive end to the positive post
on the live battery.

19
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:21,460
now for the negative. you wanna connect negative
to negative.

20
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,119
so take the black end the negative end.
connect this

21
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,060
to the negative terminal on the live
battery

22
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,640
and then the negative cable here

23
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,820
to the post on the dead battery. now as an
option

24
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,619
you can connect this the negative end

25
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,930
to either the engine block or the frame
of the car. so is it really that important

26
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:45,360
to

27
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,040
connect the cables in that exact order.
you're full of questions today aren't

28
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,130
you.

29
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,399
actually you're asking great questions.
it is important to connect positive to

30
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,070
positive and

31
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,600
negative to negative. because the battery's
current is designed to only flow in one

32
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,290
direction.

33
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,939
if that current is interrupted we could
have a battery explosion.

34
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:08,599
I wouldn't want that. the reason we
can connect the negative end of the cable

35
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:12,480
to the cars engine block or the frame on
the car with the dead battery

36
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,060
is because this helps keep the positive and
negative cable separated

37
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,920
and maximize the chance of effective
grounding. now we've got the car separated

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,760
and i think we're ready to start the car with
the live battery.

39
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:32,140


40
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,810
why do you have to start this car first.
well that's a good question.

41
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,450
by starting the car with the live
battery first creates

42
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,230
a more efficient flow of current and the
alternator of this car

43
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,390
is already recharging the battery here
so that the flow to the car with the dead

44
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:47,870
battery

45
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,489
is going to be stronger that if we did
not have this car running.

46
00:01:51,489 --> 00:02:01,340


47
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,860
now we've got the cables connected
properly and the live car running

48
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,950
we need to let this situation sit for just a
couple of minutes.

49
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,490
let the current flow from the good
battery into the bad.

50
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:17,090
couple of minutes should do it.

51
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:35,100
done.

52
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:43,600


53
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,480
okay I think you're ready to start the
car

54
00:02:45,480 --> 00:03:04,349
with the dead battery.

55
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:08,659
okay we've got the car with the dead
battery started. now we can remove the cables.

56
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:19,949
you want to do that in the reverse order. so we start by
removing the negative.

57
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:27,650
then we move on to the positive cables.

58
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,840
make sure when you're removing the cables
that none of the ends touch.

59
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,850
that could result in a spark or maybe even a
fire.
