9
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,060
position the vehicle's next to each
other. then

10
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,540
open the hood and find where the
batteries are. after you find the

11
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,260
batteries

12
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,260
look for a black or red

13
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,770
on the battery. black is minus. red

14
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,210
is plus. if there isn't a black or
red look for a minus symbol

15
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,590
or a plus symbol to determine which
terminal is which.

16
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,850
the most important thing to remember
while jump starting your vehicle

17
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,409
is to not let the jumper cable ends touch
each other. first

18
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:36,870
hook the positive jumper cable end first

19
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:44,790
laying the negative one to the side.

20
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,950
then

21
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,030
hook the negative jumper cable ends to the
negative terminal.

22
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:54,020


23
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,020
once you have the jumper cables hooked to the
batteries

24
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:07,539
you then want to start the working vehicle
and let it run for a few minutes.

25
00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:14,420
after that try starting the vehicle with the
dead battery.

26
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,729
if it still wont start let the working
vehicle run for a few more minutes

27
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:23,950
and try again. once you get the vehicle with
the dead battery started

28
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:28,479
disconnect the jumper cables by removing
the negative end first and then the positive.
