19
00:00:00,649 --> 00:00:02,869
all right so you want to take your
cables

20
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:06,509
keeping them separated from each other
at both ends of your cable.

21
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,880
red one's gonna go on positive.

22
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,149
lot of times your battery will have a little
plus mark on it

23
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:18,200
which indicates positive. or it may have a 
red

24
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,530
cable terminal which indicates positive and
then you have your black

25
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,740
which goes on negative. as you can see there's
a negative

26
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,840
sign there and a black cable as well on
the battery's side.

27
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,190
make sure you're keeping all your cables
separate from each other so they don't

28
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,630
spark

29
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,580
which can be a problem. anyhow so
that's how we're hooking up our

30
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,160
batteries and we're keeping everything

31
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,349
separated. red and black. postitive and negative.

32
00:00:47,349 --> 00:00:50,870


33
00:00:50,870 --> 00:01:07,120
kee these separated.

34
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,620


35
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:21,920


36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,060
so notice again this is a different
style of battery.

37
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,819
it's what we call a top post. our
other vehicle had a side post. but again

38
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:31,099
you see a plus mark.

39
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:34,170
you see red here. if you

40
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,890
come across a vehicle and you're
just not sure

41
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,959
the negative and positive post are two
different sizes.

42
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,650
the positive post is a bit larger. the
round post here.

43
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,300
the negative is a little bit smaller
than the postive. so that's another way

44
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,799
you can identify positive and negative
on a battery.

45
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,370
so again keeping our cables separate
we're making good contact.

46
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:04,739
see i just made a mistake. that's
black. 

47
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,220
there's your negative black. postive

48
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,950
red. that could've caused a
little bit of a problem.

49
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,459
wouldn't have blown you up but it definitely
could cause a problem.

50
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:20,580
that's the reason why I don't have
my two cables connected just yet.

51
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,400
I've got everything right now and now
I'm gonna do my last connection between

52
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,850
the two cables.

53
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,859
so as you can see I got my

54
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:35,000
cables completely separate from each
other. I'm gonna bring my red to my red.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,380
positive to positive. I'm gonna make good contact
here.

56
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,729
notice you get one side as your cable.

57
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:46,700
so I'm gonna make sure to get both cable
sides touching each other.

58
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:52,500
see the cable side. they're all
touching in the middle.

59
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,760
so that's a better contact.

60
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,310
cable side. cable side.

61
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:07,150
so now we have a good
contact and let it run for a little while

62
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:13,090
to charge it up. then we fire up the vehicle.

63
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,710
black-on-black. 

64
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:22,490


65
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:47,410


66
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,470
well because the length that the electricity has to travel

67
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:55,000
we're gonna give it a minute to
charge the dead battery.

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,800
you can tell if your battery
alternator is charging on the running car

69
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,250
you can usually hear

70
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,120
a little bit of a high pitched noise and
that means that your alternator

71
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,360
is definitely charging and your connection

72
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,650
are good. you hear that high pitched whining
from your alternator

73
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,070
because it's actually charging a little extra than
normal.

74
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,810
we let it run for a minute and then
we'll

75
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,169
go ahead and fire up the Honda. the vehicle in the
back is a big V8.

76
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:27,900
so it has a higher charging rate. so the smaller
Honda

77
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,290
shouldn't take that much to start

78
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:51,800
up. so we'll give it a minute and then start up.

79
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,420


80
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,400


81
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,930
well it's running. I'm gonna carefully
disconnect the cables.

82
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,790
make sure to keep the red and the
black

83
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,210
the positive and negative terminals
separated from each other.
