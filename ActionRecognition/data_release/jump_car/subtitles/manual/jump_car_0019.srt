43
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,939
get the hoods of both vehicles open. so

44
00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:06,999
like I said we're gonna pretend that my
decota is the dead

45
00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:07,709
vehicle.

46
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:12,639
so now this is just for demonstration
purposes but notice that both

47
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,439
batteries are on the driver side. so this
actually technically won't work.

48
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:21,180
but I don't feel like putting them end to end. alright step 1: make sure your

49
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,599
vehicle is not running.

50
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:26,109
either vehicle. well that's pretty obvious.

51
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:29,930
first step. we're gonna start with
our jumper vehicle.

52
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,779
we do not want the vehicle to be running.
we're gonna take the

53
00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:37,319
positive end of the jumper cable and
attach

54
00:00:37,319 --> 00:00:41,590
it to the good battery. now right now
we're just gonna leave the negative end

55
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,019
alone.

56
00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:46,559
okay so now the next step.

57
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,769


58
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:52,840
we take the positive lead on the other
end

59
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,379
and we attach it to the vehicles dead battery.

60
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:59,379
now on the good battery

61
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:06,379
we attach the negative cable. make sure
these are securely fastened. now on the

62
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:07,799
vehicle with the dead battery

63
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,989
we do not want to hook this up to the negative
cable. because if we do

64
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:16,769
we put this clamp on it may spark and
sparking hydrogen means boom.

65
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:21,019
so what we want is we want to come here and look and
there's plenty of metal on the engine.

66
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:24,779
right here's a nice thick piece of
metal here.

67
00:01:24,779 --> 00:01:28,519
you're gonna move it back and forth a little bit.
get a good connection.

68
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:31,689
so we always want the ground the

69
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:34,949
negative cable on the dead battery to a
good

70
00:01:34,949 --> 00:01:39,900
solid engine ground or body
ground of some sort. down the exhaust

71
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,269
manifold way down there or up on top of
the engine but it has to be something good

72
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,409
and solid metal.

73
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:47,560
so now we're gonna come and start the

74
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,650
jumper vehicle. now we come over and
we start the vehicle

75
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:58,930
with the dead battery.
