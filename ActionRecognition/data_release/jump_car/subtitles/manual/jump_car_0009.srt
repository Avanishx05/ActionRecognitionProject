14
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:16,399
take your positive jumper cable. connect it to your positive terminal of the dead battery.

15
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,390
after connecting the positive cable to the
positive terminal

16
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,930
of the dead battery you're going to
connect the positive cable

17
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,869
to the positive terminal of the charged
battery. you will then connect the

18
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:28,750
negative cable which is black

19
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,790
to the negative terminal of the charged
battery.

20
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,909
then you'll connect the negative
cable

21
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:38,340
to either your engine block or in this
case we can connect

22
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,420
it there to the frame. perfect.

23
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,270
I would let it sit there for about 3 to
4 minutes

24
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,710
and then try and turn your car over. now
once the car turns over

25
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,289
you want to reverse the process. so you
would take the negative

26
00:00:54,289 --> 00:01:00,920
cable from the frame. then you would take
the negative cable

27
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,470
from the charged battery. then take the
positive cable

28
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,750
off from the charge battery which is the red
one and then take the positive

29
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,750
cable off of the positive terminal from the dead battery.
