16
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:09,340
for the next trick we open the hoods on both cars. now that we have got the hoods open

17
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,340
on both cars battery on one side. battery
on the other side.

18
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,040
shouldn't be a problem because the cables
will be long enough.

19
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:24,570
this is the good car.

20
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,840
I'm going to start with the good car and

21
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,060
always start by putting on the
positive lead first.

22
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,570
here is something to be real mindful of. if these
are laying on the ground and they're

23
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,180
touching

24
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,890
my little incident earlier was because I
had it hooked up to a battery and I hooked the

25
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,380
two of these things together.

26
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,660
you don't want these touching. so you want
to hook these up

27
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,030
one at a time so that both are not
hooked up to one car

28
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:53,000
and then you have got these other two laying
on the ground that could potentially

29
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,530
spark in touch. so you start with the
positive battery cable.

30
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:02,380
just give it a little wiggle

31
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,700
when you put it on. that way that teeth
from the jumper cables will bite in

32
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,280
a little bit and can make a better
connection. okay which one positive and

33
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,239
which one is negative.

34
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:14,640
very good question. on top of the
battery

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,160
we'll see a lot of times

36
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,050
there is a plus sign for positive and a minus
sign for negative.

37
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,060
the positive cable will have like
something red on it.

38
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,320
like this one is red.

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,470
then the negative cable is usually
black.

40
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,780
but say in a case like this you don't know

41
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,580
you don't see a plus sign or a negative
sign. it is kinda hidden.

42
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,720
the negative cable usually runs

43
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,250
some place that touches the body
somewhere. you know. this is some place on

44
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:46,860
the body

45
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,140
or some place on the engine. the positive
cable always goes to

46
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,940
starter which is that guy. so what you
can do if you don't know which is which

47
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,630
is you can follow the cables and

48
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,530
the one that has anything that goes to
like the body of the car

49
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,209
or the outside of the engine that's the one
that's going to be negative

50
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:09,230
and of course the other is gonna be
positive. if you can't follow the negative

51
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,790
cable follow the positive cable.

52
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,859
okay now I'm gonna go to the dead car and
connect

53
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:24,000
the positive battery cable. once again make
sure that

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,650
these two do not touch. next we're going to
hook

55
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,880
the negative cable up on the good car.
there you go.

56
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,959
now here's the tricky part. you mightmy know
what's coming next.

57
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,280
you might not. don't hook the negative

58
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,060
jumper cable up to the battery on the
car that you are trying to jump.

59
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,470
a much better way to do this is to find
a good ground

60
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,299
on the engine itself. in other words find
a shiny metal spot on the engine

61
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:54,359
that you know is nice solid metal and
hook the ground cable up there

62
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:58,620
not to the battery itself. okay usually what I like
to look for is like a big hook sticking

63
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,940
up the top of the engine or something like
that.

64
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,519
this would be the engine. this is where
you would like

65
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,570
to have it mounted. the alternator

66
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,720
is an excellent place to put a cable

67
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,970
if you got enough. so how about right in here

68
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,520
on top of the alternator.

69
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,900
you wanna make sure to keep it away from
any of the spinning stuff.

70
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,000
cables are all hooked up from the good
car and the battery

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,290
and the bad car and the battery and a good

72
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:35,810
engine ground. now let's start the good car.

73
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,080
let the good car run for a little while
before you attempt to start the other

74
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,550
car.

75
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,360
give the battery time to

76
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,220
charge up a little bit before you actually
turn the key and try to start the other car.

77
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,240
if the other car is not starting

78
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,289
or it is really really dead what you might
want to do is you might want to raise

79
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:54,130
the idle up on the car that

80
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,530
is the good car and let it run into higher
idle. that will

81
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,919
allow the alternator to work a little
bit better and charge the battery up

82
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:05,180
even more than it would just by sitting
at idle. alright now I'm gonna go into the

83
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:05,949
dead car

84
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:09,550
which has been charging for a little while and try to
start it. please please please start.

85
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,259


86
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:17,200


87
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,390
alright now that both cars are running disconnect
the cables

88
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,870
on both cars. the sooner the better. you don't want to leave them on for

89
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,980
too long. you want to start with
taking the ground cable

90
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,200
off first.
