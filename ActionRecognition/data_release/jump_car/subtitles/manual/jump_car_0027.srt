18
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,810
A very important note is that you
never does this to a damaged battery.

19
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,590


20
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,800
your first step is to get another vehicle with a
working battery

21
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,650
and park them next to each other so the batteries
are near each other so that you can reach them

22
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,750
with the jumper cables.

23
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,660
the next step is to get yourself a nice set of
jumper cables so you can properly jump

24
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,680
the vehicles.

25
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,730
first you hook up the red positive side to the
dead battery.

26
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,760
then you do the red positive side on the
good battery. then you do the black

27
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,410
negative on the good battery. then

28
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,000
you take the black from the dead
battery and hook it up on some kind of

29
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,110
ground on the engine. 

30
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,160
it's best to hook up the ground as far away from the battery as possible so you don't overload

31
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:52,400
the circuit.

32
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,310
first try to start the dead vehicle like this
because sometimes

33
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,550
it's not dead dead and you will still be able
to start it like this.

34
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,270
if that doesn't work start the vehicle with the good battery and let it charge the dead

35
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,970
battery for a few minutes before you
start

36
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:08,370
that one.

37
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,850
once the good vehicle's started you want to let it run for a little while to charge up the dead

38
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,070
battery before attempting to start the other
car.

39
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,090


40
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,420


41
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,020
when you are unhooking the cables you do them
in the reverse order that you hooked them up in.

42
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,160
be sure to not to touch the cable
ends together.
