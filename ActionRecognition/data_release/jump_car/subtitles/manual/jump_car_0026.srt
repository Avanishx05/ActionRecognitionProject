17
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,400
okay step 1: this is our car with the dead
battery and this is the car with the dead

18
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:04,949
battery.

19
00:00:04,949 --> 00:00:07,769
you need to park them as close together
as you can but without either of them touching

20
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:09,190
because that could cause a spark.

21
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:15,360
turn the ignition off in both cars. first off
remove the battery cover.

22
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,470
you're looking for the positive terminal first. it is usually marked

23
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,910
red like this one here or have a
little plus sign. you connect the

24
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,960
red jump lead to the positive battery
terminal on the dead car.

25
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,840
step 2 connect the other end of the red
jump lead to the positive

26
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,670
terminal on the good car. on this car the
positive terminal isn't

27
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,830
colored red but it does have a plus
sign here. so we

28
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,100
know that's the right one. step 3:
connect the black jump lead

29
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,860
to the negative terminal on the donor
car.

30
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,800
step four. connect the other end of the black
jump lead to an Earth point

31
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,540
on the dead car.

32
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,930
step five. leave the jumper cables connected
for about three minutes

33
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,270
so that the battery voltages can equalize. make sure
that the cables

34
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,290
are moved well away from anything moving in
the engine as well.

35
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,270
make sure you remove the battery cover
at the engine compartment.

36
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,060
step 6: started the donor car and allow it to run for a
minute.

37
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,600
then while it is still running start the
dead car and leave both running for about

38
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,420
10 minutes.

39
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,680
don't remove the jump leads once the cars
engines are running.

40
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,700
step 7. turn the ignition on both cars off

41
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,990
and remove the clamps in the reverse order
that you put them on.
