11
00:00:00,989 --> 00:00:04,559
firstly check a flat battery for any
signs of damage

12
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:07,660
such as cracks or leaks.

13
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,790
never try to jumpstart a car

14
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,670
with a damaged battery as there can be a risk
of explosion

15
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,550
or fire. now we need a fully charge car
to take power from.

16
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,800
cars can be jump-started from

17
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,140
any other car with the same voltage
battery fitted.

18
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,690
most European cars operate a 12-volt

19
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,000
system. so check that both the flat and
the charged batteries

20
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,610
match. ideally the charge should come from

21
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:43,830
a similar or larger powered car. locate the
battery position

22
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,090
on both cars. then Park the fully charged
car opposite

23
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,599
to the dead car allowing a walking gap
between them

24
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:57,509
and turn off the engine. we now connect
the batteries together

25
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:00,869
using the jump leads which must be done
in this order.

26
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:04,470
connect one of the red

27
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,539
cable ends to the positive terminal on
the dead battery.

28
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:11,770
this will be identified with a plus sign

29
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:17,810
and is often red in color. connect the
opposite end

30
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:23,270
of the red cable to the positive
terminal on the charged battery.

31
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,010
attach the blacks cable to the negative
terminal

32
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:32,930
on the charged battery marked with a minus sign.

33
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,990
finally the opposite end

34
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,050
of the black cable to the negative
terminal

35
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:42,040
on the dead battery. in some instances
this can be

36
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,540
connected to any metal point in the
car's

37
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,590
engine bay. ensure that the cable

38
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,880
ends are kept apart during this process.

39
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,110
ensure that all electrical items

40
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,290
within each car are switched off such
as

41
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,990
lights heaters and radios. this makes it

42
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,080
easier to start the car by using less
power.

43
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,710
start the fully charged car

44
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,650
and let it run for three to five minutes

45
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:17,490
revving the engine as you do so.

46
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,640
now attempt to start the car with the flat battery.

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,830
it should start straight away. if not

48
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,580
leave the cars connected for a few
more minutes

49
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,890
allowing the charge to build up before trying
again.

50
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,630
once the car has been started remove

51
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:38,270
the leads in the reverse sequence. take off

52
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,440
the negative on the flat battery followed

53
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,130
by negative on the charged battery. then

54
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,420
the positive on charged battery

55
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,630
and finally positive on the flat battery.
