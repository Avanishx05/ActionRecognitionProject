8
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,280
let's go over to the vehicle with the dead
battery 1st

9
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,510
and we will hook up the red end

10
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,300
to the positive post on the vehicle with
the

11
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,129
dead battery. step two. go over to the vehicle
with the good battery

12
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:18,309
and we want to make the
connection on the positive terminal.

13
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:22,210
note that there's a plastic cover here.
some batteries have that. make sure you

14
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,320
unclip it and fold it out of the way

15
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,289
so that you can make a good connection.
step 3:

16
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,500
on the vehicle with the good battery go
ahead and hook the Black

17
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,680
cable end up to the negative post on the
battery.

18
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,860
step number four. making the final
connection with your ground cable. your

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,729
black cable.

20
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:46,149
you can hook it straight up to the
negative post of the dead battery

21
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:50,170
although it is recommended to go
straight to a chassis ground

22
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,579
so that a spark does not ignite

23
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,590
any acid that could be on top of the
Dead battery.

24
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,000
next we wanna crank up the vehicle with
the known good battery.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,770


26
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,280
we will allow this vehicle to run for
2 or 3 minutes

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,750
before you actually try to crank the other vehicle.

28
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,970
after a few minutes of charging
let's try to crank this thing up and see

29
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,500
if it'll start.

30
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,450


31
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,460


32
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,939
now you wanna leave this vehicle running. it needs to
be driven for at least 30 minutes or so

33
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,390
so the alternator can charge the battery.

34
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,210
okay so now i want to show you how to disconnect the cables. basically we do it in the opposite order

35
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:34,630
of

36
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,430
how we hooked it up. so we'll take
the negative off

37
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,870
of the

38
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:44,840
dead battery vehicle first. lay it aside. go
over to the vehicle with the good battery.

39
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,570
we will disconnect the negative. then
we will disconnect

40
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,740
the positive. then we will go back to the
vehicle with the dead battery and disconnect the positive cable in it.
