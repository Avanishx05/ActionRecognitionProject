11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,129
so the first step is to get a car that runs and pull it up to the car with the dead battery so the jumper cables could reach

12
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:06,129
both batteries.

13
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:09,320
you wanna make sure both cars are separated
and don't touch each other when you do

14
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:09,820
this.

15
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,170
you also wanna make sure that you take the keys
out of the ignition for both vehicles.

16
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,909
for each of our vehicles you want to find
the battery and find where the positive

17
00:00:16,909 --> 00:00:20,809
and negative leads are. this in my truck
battery. this is the battery that works.

18
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:24,180
so here is the positive. it's red and then
here's the negative

19
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,369
it's black. now if we go over to our van
which is not starting

20
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,610
we can look at the battery. you can see right
here

21
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,740
black cable. that's our negative and this
one is our positive it's the

22
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,110
red cable. so once you identify that we
could begin.

23
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,520
now you want to take your jumper cables and
spread them out to have one red one

24
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,070
black

25
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,210
in each hand and just detangle the wires.
here's the dead battery in our van

26
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,869
and we'll take out the jumper cables. from
this point forward we don't want the

27
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:52,570
jumper cable ends to touch each other.

28
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,619
first thing we are gonna do is take one
side of the jumper cables. we're going to

29
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:56,280
get our red

30
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,000
which is our positive and we are gonna attach it to
the positive side of the dead battery.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,150
make sure you get a good connection
right on that battery post.

32
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,710
you can see that these copper pieces are
touching the metal on the post

33
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,320
and there's a good connection. if you
want you can wiggle it around a little

34
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,010
bit. just make sure you get it in there
good.

35
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,560
the reason why you attach the red cable to
the dead battery first

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,200
is because the dead battery doesn't have
as much energy as the good battery.

37
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,979
so starting here's the safest. you could
take your ground and just put it on a piece of

38
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:24,720
plastic.

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,880
you don't want your ground touching any
bare metal. then you'll be grounding

40
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,810
it out. we'll leave it there for now.

41
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,150
we're gonna connect it to the battery in
a second. now we are gonna go over to the good

42
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:34,740
battery.

43
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,450
we're gonna grab both of our leads just like we
did before. don't touch 'em together.

44
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,489
we're going to take our red one and put
it on the positive terminal

45
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:45,709
which is also red. at the good battery
you're going to get the black lead

46
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:50,040
and we're going to attach it to our
negative side here. so attach this here.

47
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,519
now we have the black lead and the red
lead

48
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,450
on the good battery attached. back at the
dead battery this is the last lead we

49
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,400
have to attach.

50
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,690
but you are not going to attach it to the negative
battery terminal. touching a lead to

51
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,849
negative battery terminal will cause a
spark.

52
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:06,190
these sparks can ignite any fumes from
the battery

53
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,810
and cause an explosion. batteries can
create hydrogen gas especially when they

54
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,580
rundown

55
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,600
and are not working properly and hydrogen
gas is explosive.

56
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,080
so to play it safe just find another
grounding point. some cars have a ground

57
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,510
spot

58
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,640
away from the battery specifically for
jumping your car. so check your owner's

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,110
manual.

60
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,860
if not find a bare piece of metal
for the ground that isn't a moving part

61
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,730
and is not attached to an electrical
component. so when looking for a ground

62
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,830
you wanna try to find something that
is bare metal. if we look here

63
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,450
there's a nice ground here but
unfortunately this wire is pretty thin.

64
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,470
so if you don't have a good connection
to this ground this wire is thin

65
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:43,650
so you could actually melt it. a good spot to
look is on the engine. we are looking at

66
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,570
the engine here.

67
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,490
here's a nice bare piece of metal. my only
problem with this piece of metal is that

68
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,360
it's right next to the fuel pressure
regulator.

69
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,360
we're trying to avoid sparks next to
anything flammable. so this isn't a spot

70
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,480
that I would want to use.

71
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,480
but it's nice because it's a nice thick
piece of metal. its bare metal.

72
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,060
it's directly connected to the engine
so you get a good ground.

73
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,560
in my case what i am gonna do is I'm gonna go find
the strut tower.

74
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,290
as you can see on my strut tower there
is a bunch of good bolts that provide a good

75
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:09,870
ground

76
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,180
and they're also bare metal. so we're
gonna attach it to that. the other good thing

77
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,370
is this strut tower is away from the
battery

78
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,310
so we don't have to worry about sparks.
but there's tons of grounds that you could

79
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:18,830
use.

80
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:23,470
in this case this is just one of them.
just get in here and clamp right down on

81
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,040
to that.

82
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,970
make sure you have a good connection.
so with our cables all set up one last

83
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,920
thing you want to do is you want to inspect
to make sure that these cables

84
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,209
are not near any cooling fans. you can see our
cooling fans are over here

85
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:38,540
so we don't have to worry about that. our
serpentine belt is on the other side

86
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,550
so we don't have to worry about that. now
that our cables are clear lets check

87
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,640
out the other side.

88
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,900
moving to the good battery side the fan
is right here as well as the serpentine

89
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,400
belt and our cables are out of the way over
here.

90
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,370
so we're ready to jump the vehicle.
now we're gonna start the engine in my

91
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,860
truck which is the good battery

92
00:03:52,860 --> 00:04:01,760
and let it run for two minutes. 

93
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,530
my truck has been running for about two
minutes so we can start the engine in my

94
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,110
van.

95
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,620
hopefully it'll start up.

98
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,520
there we go.

99
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,009
now right away you want to go and take
off the negative terminal first.

100
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:23,259
and now if I take this off and it sparks
it is away from the battery which is being

101
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:23,919
charged

102
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,979
and potentially creating hydrogen gas.
if we take off the red terminal first

103
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:31,550
we could create a spark right here which
is on top of the battery which wouldn't be

104
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,000
good.

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,650
so we remove the negative terminal first.
don't let this touch anything.

106
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,580
then we remove our positive terminal on 
the bad battery.

107
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:45,060
make sure these don't touch. then you
remove the red cable

108
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,199
and then the black cable.

109
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,009
now your car started so you are not
stranded anymore. so let's just give a scenario

110
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:56,310
where you go to start your car and it
doesn't work.

111
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,770
it slowly drags but we don't get the car
started. let the car sit for another five

112
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,349
minutes.

113
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:05,030
let that other car that's running charge
up your battery. essentially the

114
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,960
alternator in the other car is charging
your battery so sit for five more

115
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,550
minutes.

116
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,259
take the key out of the ignition and in five
minutes try starting it again.

117
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,129
if it seems like you're really close to
starting but you just need a little bit

118
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:16,930
more juice

119
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,210
have that person in the car with the good
battery rev up the engine to about 2a000

120
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,599
rpms

121
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:27,009
and hold it there as you try to start
the vehicle with the dead battery. this

122
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:30,180
will get the alternator spinning faster
so you will have more power to start the car

123
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,110
with the bad battery.

124
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,750
after all that if all you get is a
click and you can't start your engine

125
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,159
your battery could be permanently bad.
there could be a bad cell in there, there could

126
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,360
be a shortage internally.

127
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,870
but before you give up make sure that
you have a good connection on both the

128
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,550
positive

129
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,509
and negative terminals. make sure you check
the connections on the bad battery

130
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:51,039
as well as the good battery. another
thing to do is if you attach it to this

131
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:51,669
ground

132
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:54,590
and it won't start the car try
connecting it to a better ground.

133
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,259
a lot of times switching to another ground
will start the car.
