23
00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:05,060
Park both cars in neutral next to each
other so they are close but not touching.

24
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,210
and put the handbrakes on. you don't
want them to roll away.

25
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,590
next you should pop open both car bonnets
and secure them.

26
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,920
then check that the jump leads can reach
from one car battery to the other.

27
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,729
stand over by the car with a good
battery.

28
00:00:18,729 --> 00:00:22,780
the red jump lead is the positive lead. so
find the positive terminal

29
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,149
on the working battery. now this should
have some kind of a plus Symbol

30
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:30,259
or will have a red cap or red markings.
connect to this terminal using the click

31
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:31,659
at the end of the read jump lead.

32
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:35,210
check that the teeth gripped the
terminal properly. then go back to the

33
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,530
car with the flat battery and connect the
other end

34
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,229
of this red jump lead to the positive terminal
on the flat battery. you then need to

35
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:44,329
switch back to the car with the good
battery.

36
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:48,350
pick up the black jump lead and connect
it to the negative terminal which should

37
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,719
have a minus symbol

38
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:53,490
or a black cap. now this is the tricky
bit to remember.

39
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,009
with the other end of the black jump lead
move back to the car with the dead battery.

40
00:00:57,009 --> 00:01:01,140
this time instead of connecting it to
the negative terminal you will need to find a

41
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,460
solid piece of metal

42
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,040
on the engine like a bolt or a bracket.
double-checking that its

43
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,530
firmly attached. this earthing point has
to be away from the fuel system

44
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,600
and the battery. some cars even have a
specific earthing rod for this purpose.

45
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,060
check your hand book to find out if yours does.
that should be all four ends to the jump leads

46
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,220
properly connected.

47
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,910
now once all the jump leads are hooked up wait
a few minutes for the voltages to

48
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:25,880
equalize.

49
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,730
once you have waited for a bit you'll then need
to start the engine of the healthy car.

50
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,760
leave this engine running and then try and start

51
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,750
the engine of the car which had the flat battery.

52
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,460
if it doesn't work wait a bit longer with
the engine of the other car still

53
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,600
running before trying to start the
engine again.

54
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,430
if the engine does start then leave both
cars running for ten minutes.

55
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,750
now if you notice that the jump leads
are getting a bit hot then you need to

56
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,200
turn the engines off to let them cool
down a bit.

57
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,680
after the 10 minutes are up the next step is to
turn off both the car engines.

58
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,780
then in reverse order you need to
carefully remove

59
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,480
each of the jump leads. be really careful
not to touch the clips against each

60
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:03,850
other

61
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,580
or make contact with any of the metal
such as the car's bodywork.

62
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,370
otherwise you will cause a bit of a bang. start
by carefully unclipping the black

63
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,800
jump lead from the earthing point. then 
unclick the other negative end of the same

64
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,510
lead.

65
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,160
do the same with the red jump lead 
unclipping it from the positive terminals

66
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,190
of the donor car and then the newly charged car.
