8
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,630
you will need a set of jumper cables, another car, safety glasses, rubber gloves,

9
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,530
and a wire brush.

10
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,580
step 1: setup. lift up your hood and find
your battery.

11
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,780
it's usually in plain sight at the front
of the engine compartment.

12
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,660
but check your owner's manual for the
exact location in your vehicle.

13
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,080
step two.

14
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,559
safety first. put on your safety glasses
and gloves to protect you from any

15
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,800
corrosion on the battery.

16
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,360
step 3: positive ID.

17
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,940
your battery has two terminals. a
positive

18
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:40,750
and a negative. the positive terminal is
marked with a plus sign.

19
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:46,290
the negative is marked with a minus
sign.

20
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,119
step 4: a friend in need. now you will
need to find a good samaritan

21
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,720
or friend who will be willing to give you
the gift of life. it only takes a minute

22
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:01,500
and won't harm the other person's car one
bit. step 5: power-hungry.

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,679
have the other car pull up close to your
car so the batteries are near each other.

24
00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:11,200
turn both cars off. open the jumper car's
hood

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,899
and locate the battery. step 6:

26
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:19,959
hook me up. attach one end of the jumper
cable to the positive terminal of the

27
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:20,649
dead car

28
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:24,789
and the other end to the positive
terminal of the car that will do the

29
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:25,369
jumping.

30
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:29,390
then attach the other clip to the
negative terminal of the car

31
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:35,940
donating the juice and attach the other
end to the engine block of the dead car.

32
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,959
step 7 the juice is loose.

33
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:44,490
start the car that is giving the jump.

34
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,410
never run a car in a closed space or sealed
garage.

35
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:52,410
wait a few minutes then start the car
with the dead battery.

36
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,500
if it doesn't work leave the jumper car going.

37
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,620
wait five minutes

38
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,180
then try again. if it doesn't work

39
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,550
you may have a more serious problem and
could need a tow. once your car's

40
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,020
running

41
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,250
don't turn it off as engine needs time
to recharge your battery.

42
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,460
step eight.

43
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:20,060
on your own. remove the cables in the
reverse order you attached them.

44
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,350
remove the cable on the engine block. then
the negative on the donor car.

45
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,060
remove the positive connection on the
jumper car.

46
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,360
then the positive connection on the used
to be dead car.

47
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,680
close the hood.
