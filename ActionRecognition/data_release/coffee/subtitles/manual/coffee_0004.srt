85
00:00:00,409 --> 00:00:01,300
I never knew anybody

86
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,539
a who use these in Italy who preheated the
water.

87
00:00:04,539 --> 00:00:09,909
so the water just gets added. Rather
the cold water just get added to the

88
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:15,389
bottom reservoir. the manual that
comes with this will say something about

89
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:19,180
filling water until you get to the
registration marks or to the water level

90
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:19,960
marks.

91
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,169
just as someone who spent a lot of time
looking for them there are no such marks.

92
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:28,759
what you wanna do is you want to fill the
water just up to below where the valve

93
00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:30,849
is. so just under the valve by

94
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:35,090
like a centimeter. if you don't
have a valve in your moka pot

95
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:40,189
and you are a daring soul who wants to use it anyway
the way to see how to fill the

96
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:44,310
water is to make sure that no water
intrudes into

97
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,870
this funnel-shaped grounds cone

98
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,639
when it's inserted all the way. so you can
hold it on the side and see about where

99
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:54,090
the bottom of this

100
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,860
funnel is. pop it inside to
make sure that

101
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,919
no water comes up through

102
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:04,460
this filter cone or filter
funnel

103
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,639
and that's how much water you should have. as
much as you can get in without intruding

104
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:08,759
into this.

105
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:14,400
to fill this once again probably the
ideal would be

106
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,449
freshly ground locally roasted
firstly roasted coffee

107
00:01:18,449 --> 00:01:21,650
grounded at something less than an
espresso grind.

108
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:27,330
now the grind for this the proper grind
is finer than a filter coffee grind

109
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,020
and not as fine as an
espresso grind.

110
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,189
if you get it too fine that's when you get
problems with an overpressure situation

111
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:39,419
in the the bottom part. although like I
said I've never actually seen that

112
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:39,969
and I've

113
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:43,650
stuffed these things full of coffee many times.
so to fill this

114
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,060
you take your copy which is
like I said not like an espresso ground.

115
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,430
you don't want it to be caking

116
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:54,129
unnecessarily and you fill this little coffee
filter

117
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:57,539
all the way to the top. I actually

118
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:01,169
even fill it slightly over the top.

119
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:04,800
I am just using lavazza fine ground

120
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,610
espresso coffee in a can from the
store.

121
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,409
that is pretty much what everyone in
Naples used.

122
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:16,610
Or they would use Kimbo which is a big
local brand everyone liked.

123
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,319
every now and then you see someone
using eely. Eely was probably

124
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:25,129
you know the premier or the
premium coffee.

125
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:30,039
It was also from up north and so kind of north 
south thing going on Italy where

126
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:35,029
the southerners didn't cater to
the northern products quite as much and so

127
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:38,069
the local brands of Kimbo were more
common.

128
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:42,469
then I just loosely pack it down. now
I'm not to tamping it

129
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:46,150
I'm not packing it like you would an
espresso. I just don't want it to get all

130
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,740
over the 

131
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,990
rubber gasket here. so

132
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,039
just loosely tamp it down. you screw the

133
00:02:54,039 --> 00:03:00,330
top reservoir on.

134
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,849
really tight and it goes right on the

135
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:06,930
burner on the stove.

136
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,249
my gas stove has a very high flame so
I actually set slightly off-center

137
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:14,860
so that the plastic handle doesn't get

138
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,189
full force of the flame. then you
want

139
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:21,849
kind of medium flame on this.

140
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:26,199
you don't wanna just torch it
because that will just

141
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:29,759
worsen the problem about this top

142
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,340
reservoir getting really hot and cooking the
coffee.

143
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,590
now we're going to put this on the
burner and what will happen is the water

144
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,249
in the bottom will boil

145
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:42,389
generate steam. this steam will generate
pressure, not a lot,

146
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,960
a little bit of pressure and that
pressure will force the water

147
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,669
down and then up through that siphon

148
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:54,240
that makes up the coffee cone.

149
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,340
then It'll come up into the upper
reservoir.

150
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,950
you see there's a little tower here
where that the water will come out of

151
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,000
and that will make the coffee. one thing
that

152
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,519
was common, I used to see people do in
Naples was

153
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,970
they would take a small metal pot
almost like a steaming pot of milk

154
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,690
and put all the sugar for the pot of
coffee in. when the first few

155
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,769
drops of coffee came out

156
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,930
from the the top of the moka pot
they would pour that in and cream it

157
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,010
with sugar almost like you're
making a very

158
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,279
concentrated frosting or something.
they would use a spoon and cream that

159
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,250
sugar

160
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,420
and the first few drops of coffee
together.

161
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,630
then when you poured the coffee into
that metal container after it was brewed

162
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:44,209
it would be almost like a Crema
kind of like a fake crema on top.

163
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:47,860
I'm not sure what's different. I've
tried doing that the last couple of times

164
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,959
and couldn't get it to work anymore.

165
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:53,820
I used to do this all the time
fifteen years ago. so either the

166
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,010
sugars different or the coffee is different
or I'm different but

167
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,660
in any case if you see people doing that,
the attempt is to come to a

168
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,100
pseudo crema.

169
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,519
we'll just let this go and we'll
check back in a couple of minutes.

170
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:10,070
okay we are seeing an action shot here when the
coffee is actually starting to brew.

171
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,320
the water's been on the boil here for
about a minute and should be getting pretty

172
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,329
close.

173
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:17,519
you'll see that the coffee starts to

174
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,050
first kinda ooze over the side and then it'll start to
sputter a little bit and then it should

175
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,209
come in a steady stream.

176
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:26,810
here we go the first drops are
coming out.

177
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,050
It's gonna cough a little bit. That is
what they call it where it spits some coffee

178
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,079
and then it will just  pick up a steady
stream. this is actually just

179
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:39,370
sort of skipping the cough step. you'll see it
coming out in a trickle. this will

180
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,670
speed up

181
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:45,769
as the the water begins to come down.
It'll get hotter faster and pressure

182
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:47,139
will increased rapidly and

183
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,899
it'll sort of be sputtering out. that
means it is probably a good time to consider

184
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:52,380
closing the lid.

185
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,750
because when it gets to the very tail end, when
there's more steam than water

186
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,940
this will tend to sort of sputter our
coffee out.

187
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:05,149
so let's close the lid.

188
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:09,130
this should be done hopefully in
about 45 seconds.

189
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,610
okay I can hear that this is just about
done. it's just about sputtering

190
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,860
towards the end.

191
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,000
so as soon as it's finished you want to get
this off the heat.

192
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,310
we don't want to to cook that upper
chamber any more than we need to.

193
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,410


194
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,610

195
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,130

196
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,720

197
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,839

198
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:45,120

199
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,790

200
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:53,230

201
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,740

202
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,089

203
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:04,699

204
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:06,120

205
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,579

206
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:13,779

207
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:18,250

208
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,190

209
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,899
I'm pouring this into a 

210
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:31,490
small glass as opposed to a cup.

211
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,680
before there was a semi hate mail about
that being a traditional corporate.

212
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,730
yeah I know.

213
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:39,899
I just wanted to show the
consistency of the coffee. I don't have any

214
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:43,730
clear coffee mug or coffee cup so I'll use
this little

215
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,940
luminar glass.
