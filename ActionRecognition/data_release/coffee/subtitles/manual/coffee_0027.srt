13
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,380
you can see where you're filling the water by looking

14
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,960
inside the coffee maker.

15
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:16,020
okay.

16
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,950
next we're going to fill the

17
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,710
coffee basket

18
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:21,940
with coffee.

19
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,720
of course a great cup of coffee

20
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,110
depends on using great coffee.

21
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,640
I only use coffee from la colombe.

22
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:36,090


23
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,190
so you fill the coffee basket with coffee. it's important
that you don't pack down the coffee. 

24
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,180
you just leave it kind of loose

25
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,620
inside the basket

26
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,210
so that it can brew properly.

27
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,740
and you set the basket inside

28
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,290
the bottom.

29
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,200
next you put

30
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,190
the coffee pot on top by fitting it on one side

31
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,580
and locking it on the other side.

32
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,990
you put the stovetop coffee maker on the stove.

33
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,630
you set it over heat that

34
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,700
is high enough to cook the coffee

35
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,580
but not so high that the flames come
over the side of the coffee maker.

36
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,979
and you wait for the coffee to brew.

37
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:19,950
the coffee is starting to brew.

38
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:28,810
you can see the coffee filling the coffee pot. you wanna leave the lid closed while this is happening 

39
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,560
to let the coffee brew.

40
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,849
so open up the lid.

41
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:37,079
make sure the coffee has stopped

42
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,659
coming out into the receptacle.

43
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,109
look like it has. 

44
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:44,279
so your coffee is done.

45
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:46,079
now ususally what i do is 

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,369

47
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,439
i make a latte so i put some milk into my mug.

48
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:58,819
then i heat it in the microwave

49
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:01,799
for about fifty seconds. it gets nice and
warm.

50
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,709
kind of sweet when the milk heats up.

51
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:06,459


52
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,729
pour the coffee into the mug and enjoy.
