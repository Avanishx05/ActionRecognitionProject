10
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,930
Fill the bottom chamber with water until just underneath the
steam valve. Put the filter

11
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:11,539
on top. next

12
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:18,620
fill the filter with expresso grounds.
the coffee should be loosely packed to the

13
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,889
top of the filter.

14
00:00:19,889 --> 00:00:23,190
be careful not to overfill or pack
it too hard.

15
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,059
if you do pack it too hard your pot
may be in danger of exploding

16
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:31,469
or you might just wait forever and no
coffee will appear.

17
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:36,070
the third step is just screw the top of
the coffee pot

18
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,140
on firmly. once you've done that

19
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:52,060
place this on the heat.

20
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,710
make sure the plastic handle is not too
close to the heat source.

21
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,420
I'm going to leave the lid up for a little
bit so you can see when the coffee starts

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,080
to brew.

23
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,220
but it is probably better just to leave it
down

24
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:16,190
in real life in order to avoid spills.

25
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,860
if you want to add mily to your espresso

26
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,890
while it's brewing, you can heat some on the stove.
I suggest not using milk directly

27
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,970
from your refrigerator as it might make your espresso
too cold.

28
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:32,119
When the espresso is done brewing, pour the desired amount into
your mug adding milk adding water and enjoy!
