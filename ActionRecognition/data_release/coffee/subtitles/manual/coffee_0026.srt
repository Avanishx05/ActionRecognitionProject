7
00:00:00,279 --> 00:00:07,320
fill the water in. they have this emergency valve that will

8
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,480
start spitting out if it gets too much pressure
inside.

9
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,870
you just fill the water up to a little bit below that and then you put your favorite coffee.

10
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,969
this is an espresso coffees that

11
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:25,989
at Walmart I bought. I buy whole beany 
and grind it myself.

12
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:31,129
I am not packing, I am just moving it around a little
but and those little light bits you see

13
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:34,690
is actually a Coco.

14
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,910
I got this coco bean

15
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,140
that's ground up and i added that.

16
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,920
just a little bit to give it a little extra
flavour. on the bottom of the

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,060
moka pot you can see a filter and a rubber gasket.

18
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,380
on the inside there is a post. the thing i like about
this moka pot

19
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,590
is the post in the center where the coffee 
comes out

20
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,600
is pointed downward so it won't sputter
out of the top.

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,759
I've got a couple of other moka pots that sputter
actually kinda bad.

22
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,540
if i leave them on and i leave the room, i will
come back

23
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,150
and find coffee all over the place. this is a
stainless steel. so you can use it on a induction

24
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,280
cooktop.

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,530
this doesn't take very long. I was
actually kinda surprised.

26
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,689
my other moka pots

27
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:24,950
take 4 5 minutes to cook to come up to
temperature.

28
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,990
this one doesn't take long at all and

29
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:34,369
I'll go ahead and show you here just
how long

30
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:37,670
it does take.

31
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,969
as you can see i've already made a pot. just to kind of test it out.

32
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:45,179
I've been using it for a while now.

33
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:48,260
I've really tried some nice coffees.

34
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:53,959


35
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:57,170


36
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,540


37
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,760
the moka pot works really well. it's stainless
steel.

38
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,280
you may be able to see. we've got some scruffing
here

39
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,080
where I was doing this right on this
induction cooktop and

40
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,150
I accidentaly dropped this plastic bag against
it. it melted the bag on to it.

41
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,580
so i just scraped it off.

42
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,500
before I took just a minute or two

43
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,410
and here i am at

44
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:36,269
three minutes and the coffee is percolating already.

45
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:37,910


46
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:45,120
it'll be done here pretty quick.

47
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,519
it's a really handy moka pot and as you can see it's
pretty fast too.

48
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:53,980
I was actually kinda surprised at how fast it
was. but that's the

49
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,780
bialetti venus moka pot. I really
enjoyed

50
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:05,579
doing the review.

51
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:09,790
we're done. some fresh. not exactly espresso

52
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,260
but some really good fancy coffee.
