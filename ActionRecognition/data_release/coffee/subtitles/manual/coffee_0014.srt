16
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:07,940
you gently just put it in and fill it up like that.
this is a full cup

17
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,680
machine or what they call it in English

18
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,790
a stovetop expresso maker. I just like to
call the cafeteria.

19
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,299
you put the coffee in. some people to
really

20
00:00:21,299 --> 00:00:25,479
squash it down but I don't like to
squash it down. I just like to level it out

21
00:00:25,479 --> 00:00:26,810
so it makes the boiling water go through the

22
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:32,439
coffee. the more you squash it, the

23
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,939
stronger it comes. there you have it. so you just put
it on the fire.

24
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:41,210
this will be on fire.

25
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,570
what will happen is after 

26
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,810
four five minutes the heated up water will kind of

27
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,049
rise through to go through the coffee

28
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:57,549
and come out of those two holes
on either side.

29
00:00:57,549 --> 00:00:58,420
you can just

30
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,640
hang here for a few minutes. I like to
keep an eye on it so

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,729
you don't want the coffee to come up. you
might be doing something else and the coffee

32
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:07,780
is sitting in here

33
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,479
hot on the fire so it'll burn the taste of the coffee. 
so you kind of 

34
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,229
wanna

35
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,610
hang around. it will only take three or four minutes.

36
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:21,500
these cafeteria can

37
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,110
pretty much boil anyway. Good continental delis

38
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,280
will have them. the ones you really want to be looking for

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,420
are the Italian made ones. I mean there are ones made in China 
and so forth

40
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,599
but the quality of them is not that good. There a lot of

41
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,800
places where they tend to leak on the Chinese ones. 
So you 

42
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,900
really want the Italian ones. the best

43
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,700
brand to buy from is Bialetti. They've been making them for
a hundred years. so

44
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:55,190
that is pretty much the top of the brand. 
but there are other Italian brands.

45
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,420
as long as it's pretty much made in Europe

46
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,019
at least are the ones you

47
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:05,340
really wanna go for. they come in different sizes. This
one here prints it as 

48
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,819
two cups size. there's a 3 cup, there's a 4 cup.

49
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:13,930
and they go up about to 12 cups. so you can
get some pretty big ones

50
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,280
if you're a big family.

51
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,569
the coffees you use are

52
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:26,150
the fresh ground coffee. or you can buy them in these packets
that are already prepacked. This is an Italian brand.

53
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,370
It's lavazza. It's one of the best brands you 

54
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,110
can buy. that's pretty much 
exported all around the world

55
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:39,500
so you'll be pretty hard pressed not to find this brand anywhere in the world wherever you are.

56
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,500


57
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,830
This is an

58
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,230
australin brand. They just brew really well, I mean I

59
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,860
can't fault these really as well. but depending on where you are

60
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,680
if you got a good local brand get that. you can get the
beans and ground them down

61
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,390
so you get them nice and fresh or you can just buy one of these.

62
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,780


63
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,799


64
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:08,920
now we just wait a while for the coffee to come up. 

65
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,939
the coffee cups we normally use

66
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:15,500
are these ones here. These are the typical Italian size

67
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,980
coffee cups. They are quite small.

68
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,810
the italian coffee is quite strong.

69
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,840
It's not like you are drinking the americans type of coffee.

70
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,560
all you need is half a cup of coffee

71
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,940
and that's enough.

72
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,479
what you can do, what I normally always do

73
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:41,870
is in my coffee I always put

74
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,880
some sort of alcohol.

75
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,660
you just put a

76
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,150
dash in to it and it changes the flavour altogether.

77
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,830
it gives it that really nice refined

78
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,380
elegant touch of alcohol and really tasty.

79
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,960
But you can put in any type of alcohol into it

80
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,460
like you can put whisky, brandy.

81
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,000
Any type of alcohol.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,289
Just try and add a little dozes and see how you go.

83
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:19,020
The way people move on now these days are these

84
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:24,419
new coffee machines. They're good if you're really in a rush.

85
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:28,460
I use these in the morning when I've to get to work. Put these on, 
and 

86
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,050
within 20 seconds you got a coffee.

87
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,169
however i still am a traditionalist and i still like my coffees to be done

88
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:38,900
the old fashioned way. They do have a different taste to 

89
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,639
those kind of coffees. these type of typical coffees

90
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,139
retain their flavour more.

91
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:50,110
so we'll just wait for a second for the coffee to come up.

92
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,970
okay.

93
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,750
as you can see the coffee is starting
to come out. that took us about four to

94
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,759
five minutes.

95
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,919
just keep an eye on it and it'll take about 20
seconds to come up.

96
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:06,319


97
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,860
it's just the most beautiful fresh coffee.
really tasty.

98
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:18,530
Can't go wrong. you really gotta taste these
kinda coffees.

99
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,789
and it's clean coffee. There's no residue, there's

100
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:25,900
none of the coffee beans or anything coming through. It's just nice
clean crisp.

101
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,819
so when it's just about

102
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:34,340
still coming out, you'll see it will
start to bubble.

103
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,039
as soon as the water runs out that's when you know.

104
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:43,240
there you go. that shouldn't happen but it did.
now you take it off the fire.

105
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,680
you should put thelid down.
that is a safety precaution.

106
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,190


107
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,810
that was for demonstration purposes anyway. It's good that
you saw that so

108
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,410
now you know and you're not gonna burn yourself.

109
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,340
So once the coffee's out there you go. That's beautiful nice hot coffee.

110
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,919
you just pour it into your nice glasses.
