25
00:00:08,829 --> 00:00:11,970
you don't want to use any less because

26
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,250
it needs that quantity to perform 
properly.

27
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,340
 

28
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,869
you know if you fill up over that little valve
then it's not gonna function properly if

29
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:23,130
you build up too much pressure.

30
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,399
this is a little funnel.

31
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:34,369
so we will put that in and this is what you use
to put your coffee in.

32
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:37,790
so I am just going to take a preground coffee

33
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:42,810
of course just for ease. but for best
results you wanna grind it on demand

34
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,140
just before you brew.

35
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,840
so best to use a medium setting.
you don't want to grind it as fine

36
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,730
as you would use for an espresso machine.
but you don't wanna

37
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,819
grind it as coarse as you might for a drip.

38
00:00:56,819 --> 00:01:00,440
somewhere in between usually works best.
its a bit forgiving. you don't have to be

39
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,230
precise.

40
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,500
so now i am going to go ahead and just

41
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,260
evenly put in the coffee in here. there is no
need to compress it 

42
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,550
or tamp it down too. you can't have it compressed.
it needs to be loose so that water can flow

43
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,110
through.

44
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,190


45
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,370
so as you can see I've filled up the

46
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,959
top funnel with the preground coffee.
it's all just loose. you don't wanna

47
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:30,050
pack it in as I was saying. otherwise it's not
gonna let them water through

48
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,239
at the speed you need. next step

49
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,659
is to put this together.

50
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,510
so you've got with your stove top there will be a

51
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,470
a silicon ring that's going to form a
neat seal here for you.

52
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,790
a little filter screen that's
gonna stop a lot of 

53
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,300
the grinds getting through into your actual
drink. so we put this together.

54
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,610
filter in. 

55
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:05,200
and then put the ring in.

56
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,440


57
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,640
then easy as screwing the two together.

58
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,099
so you wanna do that

59
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,370
until it's just tight. not too tight otherwise
you will

60
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,010
wreck it. just enough to form a neat
tight seal.

61
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,879
now once that's on

62
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,680
nice and firm, the next step. step 3 I
guess.

63
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,650
just pop it on to medium
heat on your hot plate and

64
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:48,060
start the brewing process. so you wanna take care
not

65
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,240
to get your handle over the direct
source

66
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,570
of your heat. so if you're using gas or a burner

67
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,919
you don't want obviously the hot heat up
on this handle.

68
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:02,900
You're going to need to grab on to it. You don't
want to melt it. if it's something like an electric

69
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,660
one here

70
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,320
just keep it off to the side so it's
not in direct heat. these handles are

71
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,310
designed to stay relatively cool to touch.

72
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,570
so then of course this is going to take
probably

73
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,870
you know about five minutes to happen.

74
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,600
we'll come back when it starts to starts
to brew. so I'll take a few minutes just to

75
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,530
explain what's happening in the process
of brewing this coffee.

76
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,960
so the nature of a stovetop or a house design is
that you filled up the bottom reservoir

77
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,389
with cold filtered water.

78
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:37,400
by applying the heat source what it's going
to do is heat that water

79
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,180
of course creating steam which is going
to build up

80
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,090
pressure in this bottom compratment. the pressure
that builds up in there once it gets to

81
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,860
the right point

82
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,250
is going to start forcing that heated
water up through the bottom of that funnel

83
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,770
and go through the coffee grinds
which is going to be the extraction of

84
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,990
the coffee.

85
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,530
The brewed espresso is then
going to come out

86
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,160
of the top of this spout here

87
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,880
any into this sort of holding reservoir
at the top.

88
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,960
that's where the coffee ultimately 
finishes its Brew.

89
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,100
as i was saying it's important not to
have the heat too high

90
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,800
because what that will is burn the
coffee is one thing

91
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,419
heat the water too quickly and too hot.

92
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:29,620
you want to avoid that. so that's why I
suggest a medium heat to start with.

93
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,990
you want to experiment what's best for
you.

94
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,470
you know some people might find they need a hotter
heat or a lower heat

95
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:41,280
depending on their stoves. this is still
just heating up gently.

96
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,000
now unlike a high espresso

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,080
or a proper espresso brewed under

98
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,180
extreme pressure there is not going to be that

99
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,300
lovely thick golden crema that you get at the top
of those

100
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,460
extractions. what you'll find is

101
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,630
a small amount of crema sitting on top. I
suppose you can call it that.

102
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,660
you'll see when the brew happens
what's going on there.

103
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,970
basically you don't get that
rich thick

104
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,120
honey like crema that you would of a

105
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:21,139
high-pressure extraction because this is
the pressure and this is not quite as much.

106
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:24,630
some of the things that I like to use
the espresso for of course it's a lovely

107
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,509
smooth

108
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:28,990
way to brew your coffee and tends to
get rid off a lot of

109
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,509
the bitterness.

110
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:37,160
we can start to hear that bubbling up in the
bottom now.

111
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,680
it seems to balance out the flavors
really well. I find that they are usually quite

112
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,380
a smooth

113
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,819
coffee to drink.

114
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:50,699
I really quite full boil it though
so they do stand up quite well to milk.

115
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,220
if you like to heat milk and
use the espresso

116
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,479
in that to make your sort of froth whites and
things that's

117
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:01,520
also a good way to serve it.

118
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,599
here we go. as you can see the coffee just

119
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:07,960
starts to gently pour out the top.

120
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,349
if this is happening too quickly or

121
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:17,129
it's flowing out really fast then you
know you've got the heat too high.

122
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:20,340
so what we are gonna do is sort of watch this

123
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,009
brewing.

124
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,400
I like to use a bit of a gauge
when 

125
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,090
it's about three-quarters two-thirds
three-quarters full I like to remove it

126
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,120
from the heat source.

127
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,150
because you don't want to run the
bottom hot dry.

128
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:43,259
So I'm going to take it off the heat now. It's nearly done.

129
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:47,039
so basically it's running out of water
now to push up through the funnel.

130
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,289
this extractions is pretty well complete.

131
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:53,629
So what i do is i sort of just let that sit

132
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:58,690
to finish bubbling away and we'll be back in
a few moments. so now that the brew is 

133
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,610
complete all serve it up just like I would
here

134
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,719
at home. if you are after a more long
black style of drink, simply pour out your desired amount of coffee.
