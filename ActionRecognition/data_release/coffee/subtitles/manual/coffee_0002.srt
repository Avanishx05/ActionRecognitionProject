17
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,900
All the italians I've ever seen

18
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,400
use water right out of the tap.

19
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,750
Now that the base is filled with water, you want to put the filter
into the bottom. And it fits really easily.

20
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,630
Then you're going to fill the filter with 

21
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,670
coffee grounds. The only important thing is to not pack the 

22
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,049
grounds tight. Because if they're packed too tight, the water can't escape.

23
00:00:30,049 --> 00:00:33,600
You'll just be basically baking the moka on the stove.

24
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,070
Now that that's finished, you wanna take the top part 

25
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,590
and screw it really really tight to the base. 
Because if it's 

26
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,290
not tight, water will leak out all over your stove and trust me, it has happened to me a lot of times.

27
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,420
Now we're ready to brew

28
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,600
our espresso. And you want to use a flame that's

29
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,049
in between low and medium. Because if the flame is too high the water 

30
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:59,270
goes through the coffee really fast and doesn't pick up any of those

31
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:06,800
great aromas or flavours. So our italian espresso should be ready

32
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,989
in about 5 minutes. So our moka has been on the stove

33
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:13,209
for a few minutes. so I'm gonna open the lid
and check

34
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:17,940
if we are brewing espresso. 

35
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,319
see how it's coming out of the little metal part in
the middle.

36
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:25,349
do you hear that? that rumbling

37
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:29,379
sound is your moka telling you your
delicious espresso is

38
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:33,890
ready. so when you hear this sound,
take it off the

39
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,180
flame immediately. Because it's

40
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,950
done.

41
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,110
Look. You have a whole pot of coffee inside. If you like sugar

42
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,930
or the people that you're making coffee for
like sugar you can add it 

43
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:54,900
right into the moka. So now your coffee is pronto.

44
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,950
it's ready to drink. we just have to drink it.
