58
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,750
this is a very traditional grinder.

59
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,810
The best place to store beans 

60
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,670
is not outside, is not in
the fridge

61
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,400
but in the freezer. the best place to store beans.

62
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,140
so we're going to grind the beans now.

63
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,910


64
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,880
you can play a little game when you grind the beans. Pretend you're
at the cup final.

65
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:41,820
Milan versus Barcelona.

66
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,180
or you could think you're in Spain.

67
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:55,020


68
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,990
Beans are done.

69
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,830


70
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:04,230


71
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,139
Fill water.

72
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:12,730


73
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:16,100
Fill it there like I said. Up to that level.

74
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,770
There. Perfect. Pop it in.

75
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,400
if you have you too much water it'll become quite evident here

76
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,990
it'll come to the hose. In this case it hasn't happened therefore

77
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,690
we filled it properly. Get your coffee.

78
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,100
watch this now. this is very important.

79
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,330
don't press it. don't tamp it. It doesn't like
being tampered with.

80
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,690
so you just fill it up. 

81
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:48,990
make a little mound. if it's higher, it doesn't matter 
because it'll just be a bit stronger.

82
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,010
That's okay. there's no problem with that.

83
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,650


84
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:03,780
put it on. Make sure there's no water in here after washing.

85
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,030
now we'd like to cook it.

86
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,460
because this ting is so high up from the element,

87
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,220
it takes a long time. so i do this.

88
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,740
put it right on top of the element.

89
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,729
this may not always work in your house. your
kitchen your oven might be different

90
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:25,690
from this one. here is how we light it.

91
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,300
this is very old fashioned.

92
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,340
we turn it down, not too high because it will burn the handle.

93
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,539
put it on here like that

94
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:39,550
and you wait 

95
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,500
for the horses to come. which is what we call

96
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,150
the steam stampede. now with this coffee

97
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,570
would like espresso.

98
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,490
George Clooney and John Mackey

99
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,280
each with their artificial coffee

100
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,190
in those plastic containers. try opening one

101
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,300
before you make coffee. open one of those espresso

102
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,130
coffee and see what's in there and  Smell it.
it is full

103
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:12,340
of preservatives, artificial stimulants

104
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,199
everything. and furthermore, it is wrapped in
plastic. I have a theory about plastic.

105
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,220
my theory is that the only thing that

106
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,690
should be stored in plastic is a penis.

107
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,990
we go back here again. Condoms of

108
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,120
course I was referring to.

109
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,110
Nothing else should be put in plastic. Plastic is a
petrochemical

110
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:39,349
and it leaks into the product. we don't worry about

111
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:43,400
the semen business. we are not talking about that now. We are cokking here now at the

112
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,280
moment. this is not a program about sex not
to be confused.

113
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,520
by the way ladies and gentlemen watching if there
are any

114
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,949
children watching this program it might
be best 

115
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:57,360
to send them off to some other room now because this cook

116
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,610
is liable to say anything. thank you. 

117
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,889
now I have another theory about coffee
because I'm a purist about coffee.

118
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:08,469
number one is I don't use sugar and I don't use milk.

119
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:11,590
I have a theory about milk.

120
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,520
cow's milk is for baby cows. Sheep milk

121
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,949
is for baby sheep. Goat's milk is for baby goats.

122
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:24,380
for us humans if you are going to use milk then

123
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,960
it should be 

124
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,580
breast milk. because we can't do this.

125
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,759
but we use soya milk.

126
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,210
but then again as I say I don't really

127
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,740
totally approve of milk in coffee.

128
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,229
Soya milk. Organic

129
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:47,620
soya milk.

130
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,610
The best way to cool coffee

131
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,930
believe it or not is cold coffee

132
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,979
from a previous brew.

133
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:02,050
what you should always do when you make
coffee is make more of it than you want.

134
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,459
The coffee that you leave over, 

135
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:09,630
you put it in a jug and you put it in
the fridge. cold coffee

136
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:13,440
to cool hot coffee. what can be more logical
than that?

137
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,930
why would you be tainting you coffee
with something other

138
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,450
than coffee. if you want pure coffee you
cool it with coffee.

139
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,180
but we don't always think like that.

140
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,520
therefore, the next best thing to cool

141
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,730
coffee is water. because that's what
coffee is made with.

142
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,760


143
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,810
now because we're having just a little 

144
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,950
amount of coffee, I'm going to go and get some very small cups.

145
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,430


146
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,209


147
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:53,630


148
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,860


149
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,480


150
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,540

151
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,140


152
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,920
so we are going to go ahead now with the

153
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,930
preparation of the coffee.

154
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,970
Pretty nice

155
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,360
Regina's cups that she imported from

156
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,600
Italy.

157
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,550
some of you might have

158
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,880
nice organic chocolate whipped coffee

159
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,960
this time of the day. we have some nice organic choclate.

160
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,760


161
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,110
the coffee should be nearly ready now. I'd like

162
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,490
you to watch what is happening here. because this is a
very important part

163
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,040
of the process. watching the coffee

164
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,080
coming through the mountaintop. it is

165
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,970
basically like a beautiful orgasm is how

166
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,670
I've always described it in my cokkery books.

167
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:10,000
but today because if the children are still
watching perhaps I shouldn't say that.

168
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,930
in effect

169
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:18,280
this is a mokaorgasm. watch it now here.

170
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,550

171
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,390
the coffee is just coming through.

172
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:29,380
you are going to hear it. the steam stampede.

173
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,620
Listen.

174
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,420
Listen to the horses coming.

175
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,370
can you hear them? when the hosrses are just

176
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:47,660
close you know exactly.

177
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:54,769
now you make the horses go away again. they have

178
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:58,610
just passed the House. 

179
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,769
brewing coffee like this

180
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:06,329
touches the 5 senses. Sight

181
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:10,459
sound taste

182
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:14,630
smell and we touched the beans.

183
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:19,800
An espresso? What is an espresso? why would
anybody want to

184
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,380
drink an espresso? can you tell me that? we
are now going to taste the coffee.

185
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,070
so you watch this,

186
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:42,649
this is liquid gold.

187
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:47,070
this is the ultimate taste.

188
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:52,700
this is opium.

189
00:08:52,700 --> 00:09:00,740
the opium of masses.
