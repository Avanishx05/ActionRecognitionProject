40
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,960
the maximum amount of water regardless of the size of your stovetop maker that you want to use

41
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,160
is right up to this boiler valve. you want to have
this boiler

42
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,470
valve above the water level. so can see that also inside.

43
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,950
so once we fill out the water then we

44
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:25,480
take our funnel and our grounds.

45
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,760
we loosely fill the espresso grounds

46
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,540
into the funnel. we don't wanna pack it or
tamp it

47
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,130
for these makers because the maximum
pressure they produce

48
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,450
is basically whatever they can produce

49
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,640
by water boiling and that is not

50
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,310
very strong. so in order for the water to
percolate through the grounds

51
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:53,870
you only wanna fill it up loosely into the funnel.

52
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,410
then you kind of use your finger to level

53
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,150
it a little bit. put the funnel back into the boiler and then 
just screw the

54
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,540
top compartment back on the boiler.

55
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,810
so that's that. that's all we have to do

56
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,980
for our espresso. so we put that aside.

57
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:19,620
prepare the milk frother.

58
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,859
so now we are gonna prepare our milk frother

59
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:25,439
which is even easier compared to preparing

60
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,439
the espresso. all you
do is you take the milk frother.

61
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:34,689
take our milk and fill that into the frother.

62
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:39,669
this is a 6-cup.  translate into about
32

63
00:01:39,669 --> 00:01:43,190
fluid ounces completely filled. but the way
you want to do it is

64
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:47,550
you only wanna fill these about one-third of
the frother up to a half.

65
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,639
that's the max you should do. because you need some
air on top

66
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:55,720
for the froth to expand of course and
also to have some sort

67
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,770
of air circulation.

68
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,530
you can pretty much use any type

69
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,440
of milk you want. cold milk froth as well. warm milk
froth is

70
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,669
fantastic. the perfect
temperature

71
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:13,060
for warm milk to forth is about a
hundred

72
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,340
and forty five to a hundred and fifty degrees farenheit. if it is too hot

73
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,229
it kind of changes the consistency
of the milk and you can

74
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:25,710
have this sort of a white liquid that you don't want.
so if you want to have a 

75
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,909
nice creamy cup of cappucino with a nice

76
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:32,550
firm and airy froth then you wanna

77
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,789
not exceed 150

78
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:40,020
degrees. one note to the lid. the lid is not

79
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,680
sealing the frother. it's not supposed to seal it. so

80
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,240
when you ultimately froth, you will see some
milk

81
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,440
and spilling or froth explanding on the edge of the

82
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,889
lid which is totally normal. it's not going to splatter all

83
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:58,720
over the place. but it's just not sealing

84
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,840
the frother because it has to leave

85
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,430
some air in the frother. to not create a vacuum inside

86
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,810
otherwise you couldn't froth and also to provide some sort
air circulation

87
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,690
for the froth to expand. so spilling or milk coming out
of the side

88
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,030
on the lids, on the top is completely normal. so basically that's

89
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,259
all we have to do. now we just have to put it on
the stove

90
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:27,669
and it takes about 4 to 5 minutes.

91
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:30,020
so the next thing we have to do is simply

92
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,059
take our espresso maker, put it on the 

93
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:37,449
heat source. you wanna use a 

94
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:41,009
medium high setting. you don't wanna exceed medium high.

95
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:44,839
you want to have a gentle process of brewing. it really
doesn't save

96
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:48,059
you much time. so uses a medium high setting

97
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:51,300
that doesn't burn your espresso and has a good impact on the

98
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,330
taste of the espresso.

99
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,399
then we use the body of our milk frother without the plunger

100
00:03:57,399 --> 00:04:02,460
of course. also put this on the stove. also in this case use a medium high setting.

101
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:09,070


102
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,680
as I mentioned before the perfect temparature for frothing

103
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,380
milk is about a 145 to 150 degrees farenheit.

104
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,670
i think it's very useful to use a 

105
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:23,480
thermometer. i mean while doing it you kind of
get the feeling

106
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,130
when the perfect temparature is reached. the thermometer really takes the guesswork out of it. makes

107
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,540
it much easier. so i'm using a thermometer. put it in the milk on the side of the milk frother.

108
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,630
if it reaches about a 140 145

109
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:53,340
just switch it off. now this is the perfect temparature.

110
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,730
once the milk reaches the proper temperature

111
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,380
which again is about a 145 to 150 degrees farenheit

112
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,070
and once your espresso is done brewing

113
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,380
all you have to do is take it off the stove and pour yourself a nice creamy

114
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,350
cup of cappucino. we do recommend using oven mitts
to do so

115
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:14,420
because especially if they are made of stainless
steel

116
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,660
the handles can get quite warm. you want to make sure you

117
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,030
don't burn yourself.

118
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:24,130


119
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,000
so frothing a moka is very easy.

120
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,390
all you have to do is you take your milk
and you take the plunger and the lid.

121
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,930
put the plunger on the top
of your frother.

122
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,640
you see I am doing it very lightly.

123
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,470
you can achieve different results if you froth it a little longer.

124
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,960
it kind of creates a firmer froth if you

125
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,840
like I do froth just a few times you have
a very nice

126
00:05:50,840 --> 00:06:00,690
airy froth.

127
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,990
so all that's left to do now is so
simply take your espresso and pour into your cups.
