35
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:07,860
fill the lower chamber with water almost up to the safety release valve. never overfill and never let
anything inside or outside the moka pot

36
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,520
cover the safety release valve. the only
proper way to use a moka pot is to

37
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,280
fill it up

38
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,459
to the point just under the safety
release valve.

39
00:00:17,459 --> 00:00:21,690
insert the funnel-shaped coffee basket
into the lower chamber stem first.

40
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,930
then add espresso ground coffee to the
basket.

41
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,510
do not grind the coffee any finer than
an espresso level grind.

42
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,560
true espresso is tamp down so that it
forms a park.

43
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,599
but for the moka pot gently pack the
coffee into the basket

44
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:45,580
but don't tamp it down.

45
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:49,580
finally replace the collecting chamber
over the unit and screw it tightly into

46
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,220
place.

47
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,900
when everything is ready set the moka
pot onto the stove.

48
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,280
ideally you should have a burner that
fits the pot.

49
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,120
but this is the smallest burner on my
stove. turn the heat to medium-high.

50
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,760
in about 4 to 5 minutes you may hear a
slight hissing

51
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,900
or rumbling as the brewed coffee makes
its way up the stem.

52
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,140
you can open the pot to check the
progress. when about a third of the

53
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,240
coffee has collected in the chamber

54
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,770
lower the heat. when about half to
two-thirds of the coffee has collected

55
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,630
in the chamber

56
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,940
turn off the heat and remove the moka pot from the burner.
the water in the lower chamber is so hot that it will finish the process.
