9
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:08,380
First thing we're gonna do is take out the filter. set that aside. we're gonna fill up the water.

10
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,719
so we are gonna be using three hundred forty
milliliters of water

11
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,240
on this particular moka pot. that
just comes

12
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,250
right under the released valve

13
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:25,950
that you kind of see on the outside.

14
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,200
now that we have that set,

15
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,479
we are just gonna set that
water

16
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,899
that sits at the base aside.

17
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:42,330
now we will prepare the filter. so

18
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,229
to prepare the filter we're going to be
using 26 grams of coffee.

19
00:00:46,229 --> 00:01:06,849
I'm just gonna lay that out. 

20
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:12,209

21
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:17,030
we are going to set our grinder and
for the moka pot, I suggest a grind that

22
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,590
is

23
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,840
slightly finer than drip.

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,030


25
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,319

26
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:53,160


27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,430
as you'll notice here

28
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,980
I grind directly into the basket. much
like you would do for espresso.

29
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,740
I'm gridning directly into the
portafilter. just be careful how much

30
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,849
you settle

31
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:09,510
because it can easily fit a lot more
than 26 grams in the basket. depends

32
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,739
on how hard you settle.

33
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,860
so it may look a little bit deceptively
low.

34
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,650
an important reminder.
although it looks kind of like the

35
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,330
basket

36
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,900
of an espresso machine, do not tamp it.

37
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,660
a moka pot is not designed to deal with

38
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,790
a pocket that's that dense.

39
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,830
if you tamp it has a good chance of
popping the release valve.

40
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,890
so now that we have

41
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,730
our coffee all set and we have the moka pot reassembled

42
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,519
we will get ready to set it up.

43
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:52,299
so just turn the heat up to high.
if you are using a stovetop burner then

44
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:57,450
it's probably going to be medium
medium-high. we're just gonna hit the clock.

45
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,790
okay so now we have a top view. so this
total process should take about five

46
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,220
minutes

47
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,140
start to finish depending on how fast
takes your water to heat up.

48
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,200
so we're actually gonna go ahead and
skip

49
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,920
towards the end. so this is about four
minutes 45 seconds now into it.

50
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,540
we're gonna see that the coffee is
beginning to come out. so

51
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,670
right as the coffee begins to come out I
like to lower the heat to about fifty

52
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,720
percent of what it was.

53
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,049
so for me it's lowering it from high to
medium. if you are on the stovetop then maybe

54
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:32,550
from medium-high to medium-low

55
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,120
or something like that. what we are going to do is
we are going to wait

56
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,800
as it approaches the

57
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,110
very base of the spout. right as it hits
the base of the spout we're gonna turn off

58
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:53,870
the heat altogether.

59
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,890
so it's right about now. right at the
beginning of the spout. so

60
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:03,160
turning off the heat and the residual
heat is actually gonna carry this

61
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,790
extraction all the way to the end. the
reason to lowering the heat is that we really

62
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,760
don't want

63
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,370
the water to be bursting
out at the bottom from start to finish.

64
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,840
we really wanna kinda temper that heat and 
tempe that pressure because remember

65
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,020
controlling that heat is also controlling the
pressure and the rate at which the

66
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,610
water's coming out from the bottom. if the heat is
on full blast

67
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,930
the whole way through then it'll definitely
be splattering out. so

68
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,300
now that we're finished we're gonna go
ahead and

69
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,550
pour the moka pot. so if you're using a
stovetop burner

70
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,760
or an electric one you might wanna
take it off the actual burner as it

71
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,170
will continue to

72
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:43,290
heat the moka pot even after. So we're just
gonna go ahead and pour.

73
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,500
first pour carefully especially if you are
pouring from such a high distance.
