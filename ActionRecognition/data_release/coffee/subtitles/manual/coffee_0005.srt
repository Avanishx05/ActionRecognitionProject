11
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:11,879
Fill the bottom of the pot with water to about the center of the pressure
valve. now put the basket in place.

12
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:15,559
to make sure you didn't put too much
water in the bottom tap the basket.

13
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:19,720
if water comes up you have a little too
much. the moka pot is made to make an

14
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,979
exact amount of coffee.

15
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:24,180
you really need to put the right amount
of water in the pot.

16
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,390
next we'll fill the filter basket with
fine ground.

17
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,540
use six or seven grams of coffee per
ounce. today for our coffee

18
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,649
we're using a Parisi coffee original
espresso Blend.

19
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,090
this is a fantastic espresso

20
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,600
that's truly small batch roasted with the
flavor profile

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,939
constructed specifically for this kind of
coffee making.

22
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:48,450
so how do you know just how fine the
coffee needs to be ground.

23
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,619
one simple way is to go to your nearest
grocery store.

24
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:56,170
buy a small amount of coffee beans, maybe a
quarter pound and grind it in the stores

25
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,109
coffee grinder.

26
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:00,159
just like this one. grind it on the
espresso setting

27
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,640
and use this as your control sample. so
you know what the coffee should look

28
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,030
like

29
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,630
when you grind it at home. you want to
make sure there's no coffee

30
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,469
in the stores grinder before you
prepare your sample. loosely fill this

31
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:13,299
basket and don't pack it down.

32
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:18,609
it's okay if the basket is just over
filled. now we screw the top piece on tightly.

33
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:21,659
settle it on the stove. watch and listen.

34
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,229
when you see the steam and hear the pot
rumbling, yur coffee is ready.
