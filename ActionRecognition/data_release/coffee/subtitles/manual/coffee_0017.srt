66
00:00:01,109 --> 00:00:06,259
I just fill up

67
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:10,870
the filter basket to the top. Like this.

68
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:16,479
And you'll probably actually want a little bit more coffee than what I put in here.

69
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:20,560
But you'll just want to make sure that it's
nice and level.

70
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,800
while filling up the entire filter basket

71
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,220
you don't want to go over the edges. you
don't want any coffee around the edges.

72
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:35,650
so I'm gonna just remove the filter
basket real quick because I haven't

73
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:36,580
added my water yet

74
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,789
and I would recommend actually doing
that

75
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:43,050
before you do what I just did.

76
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,759
so before I mess anything up here and
spill coffee all over the ground

77
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,229
I will resume once I have the water
in there.

78
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:55,080
okay so once again you do not want

79
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,530
your water being too high up there.

80
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,319
I've used

81
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:05,889
this little notch (pressure release valve) once again

82
00:01:05,889 --> 00:01:10,060
to kind of gauge how high the water
should be. If the water is too high it's

83
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,460
going to come up into the filter basket
before

84
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,539
the thing is even heated.

85
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:21,569
so here's my filter basket with the coffee.
You don't want to tamp this.

86
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:25,069
just keep it loose and

87
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:30,340
as evenly distributed as possible.

88
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,229
Ok? Like that.

89
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,270
We'll screw the lid on.

90
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:40,380
So, one of the things I really like about this coffee maker it's really easy to use.

91
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,979
one of the claims that people have is that
it's all

92
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:50,530
aluminum and whether there is

93
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,789
accurate research or not. people think

94
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:57,070
that leeched aluminum is terrible for your
health.

95
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:01,600
I am of the camp that doesn't believe
that.

96
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,800
I don't think there has been enough
research that has shown that

97
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,930
but even if it is bad for you

98
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:12,860
I'd much rather have aluminum in my final
cup of coffee then

99
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,979
unknown plastic chemicals.

100
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:20,820
so I'm gonna show you
how this works.

101
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,620
I'm just gonna put it on the stove

102
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,009
and have it running on low heat. The brew time itself is very

103
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:32,490
very long in my opinion. Takes at least
10 minutes.

104
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,150
as far as

105
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,330
portability goes this is probably the
best option. I'm going to take this

106
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,090
camping

107
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,430
over my Aeropress probably so I'll get more
coffee out of it.

108
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,710
it's very good I think it's better than
French press. so

109
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:52,360
I'll see you on the other end at the stove.
okay.

110
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,010
so let me first show you about how hot

111
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,220
or how high

112
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,400
your burner should be.

113
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,770
so this is too much it's too hot.

114
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,840
I have it down to about here.

115
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:15,840
so very low-heat. I'm not sure how these
are supposed to work on an electric stove.

116
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,629
I think it's fine but you'll wanna check

117
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:21,169
on that yourself with the manufacturer.

118
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:26,650
I think it says in the instruction booklet.
other reviewers also have information on

119
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,120
that

120
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,139
but basically a very low flame is what
you want.

121
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:33,949
once you start hearing that hissing
noise

122
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:37,960
you'll notice that coffee starts to brew and

123
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,659
come out of the spouts here and it
should come out in

124
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:44,870
an espresso-esque color.

125
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,189
so you'll see

126
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:51,879
some creaminess but this isn't espresso. It doesn't have enough

127
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:55,069
bars of pressure to make it

128
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:58,879
espresso, officially.

129
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,849
Hence, the moka name. so it's a different type of coffee

130
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:06,930
but a very good one, very rich, lots of
oils.

131
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,729
so I'd say it's most similar French
press but

132
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:14,949
much more low maintenance. you don't have to do any plunging

133
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:18,409
stirring or any of that nonsense

134
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:19,270
and

135
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:23,590
it's also much easier to clean, and I'll show you
that whole process after this is done

136
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,190
brewing.

137
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,650
So once it starts to brew, I'll turn the camera back on

138
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,780
so you can see what it looks like.

139
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,320
Ok. So we're about 5-7 minutes in

140
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,880
and you can already see

141
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,880
the coffee coming out of the spout at the top
and you can hear

142
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,030
that

143
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,480
sizzle if you will.

144
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,500
here's what I was talking about.

145
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,550
I don't know if you see what's going on but

146
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,190
the flames are starting to go crazy because

147
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,230
water is seeping out of the sides here.

148
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,630
so thats one of the downsides of this coffee maker.

149
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,950
I don't
know if maybe I'm doing something wrong

150
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:20,420
and that's definitely possible

151
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,480
but it doesn't seem really have an
impact on on

152
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,089
the overall output. it doesn't really
create a mess. Just something to note.

153
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:32,370
Some of that water is lost on the side

154
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,490
so you can see

155
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,319
or maybe you can't... the very rich

156
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,740
looking coffee. got something

157
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,930
that's close...I mean it isn't crema. But it looks delicious.

158
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,639
maybe that's where it

159
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:59,639
gets its moka name...the dark color of it.

160
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:04,420
the question...this is another downside.
you do have to

161
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,759
keep an eye on this thing because once
the coffee stops

162
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,040
coming out of the top there or it starts to look

163
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,389
clear that's when you want to take this
thing off the heat.

164
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:19,870
So you're not going to get any beep of course to tell you when it's done, you'll just have to keep an eye on it.

165
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,269
so already it's starting to look a
little bit thin and watery.

166
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:28,500
so I'll want to be taking it off

167
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:35,500
the burner any second now.

168
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:39,690
In fact, I think I'll do that right now.

169
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:44,970
so there's a look at it.

170
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:51,970
I'm gonna pour it out to show you what I was talking about...

171
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:56,410
this is enough coffee for

172
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:02,019
one of these mugs.
