48
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:10,299
you fill the water all the way to the safety valve

49
00:00:10,299 --> 00:00:14,909
right there. you put the filter on.

50
00:00:14,909 --> 00:00:18,689
at this point

51
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:21,819
you put some really good

52
00:00:21,819 --> 00:00:28,129
quality coffee.

53
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:31,780
made a mess.

54
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,769
don't press it. just make sure that there is no coffee

55
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:36,640
on the side of the rim.

56
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,329


57
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:46,939
put the top part on. now lets go to the stove.

58
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:59,379
ok this is not my stove

59
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:05,799
so i'm not familiar with it. alright so now we are going to let it boil.

60
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,359
all the water will

61
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,639
percolate up the tube and we're 

62
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:16,590
gonna have awesome coffee. we are going to wait for
that to

63
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,690
happen. alright so we have started getting some
percolation happening here.

64
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,160
as you can see it's coming out the tube

65
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,750
and it's filling the top canister.

66
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,880
I'm gonna close this top.

67
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,699


68
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:41,740
it's filling up

69
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,789
pretty fast. now this is how you know

70
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:53,979
that it's all done with the water. because it makes this sound. so at this point

71
00:01:53,979 --> 00:02:04,810
you just turn it off. it's all set. now let's get a cup.

72
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,550
supposedly you should use one of these small
cups you know like the Italian cups but I

73
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,340
like a big cup of coffee

74
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,590
and a lot of milk.
