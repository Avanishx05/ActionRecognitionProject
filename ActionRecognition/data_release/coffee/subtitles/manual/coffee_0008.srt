37
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:15,660
They say to fill it up to that line. so we're going to do that.

38
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,860
you don't wanna go more than that
because

39
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,459
then when you put your

40
00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:24,730
coffee grounds in you wanna make sure

41
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,350
that the water doesn't come up in this
area because you don't want to get your

42
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,360
coffee grounds

43
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,390
wet before you actually make your coffee.

44
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,500
so take this over here.

45
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,040
I have some coffee already ground
in my grounder here.

46
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:53,170
Finely ground 

47
00:00:53,170 --> 00:01:01,240
espresso coffee.

48
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,530
okay I have put the coffee

49
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,150
into the basket. you'll notice I've got it
pretty well

50
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,990
full but they caution you

51
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,080
not to pack it. if you pack the
coffee 

52
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,280
grounds in there you could cause

53
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,150
the steam not to come through the way
it should.

54
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,320
you could build up pressure in that. 
That wouldn't be a good thing. okay so now I'm

55
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,720
gonna

56
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,160
screw the top on and set it on the stove
top

57
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,700
and we'll see what it does.

58
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,230
we have the top screwed on.

59
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,830
something I neglected to mentiona while ago is

60
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,430
around the top of the

61
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,660
coffee basket you have to make sure that it
stays good and clean.

62
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,140
When you screw it back together so that you
make good seal between the bottom and the top.

63
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,340
there is a rubber gasket in there that you want to
make sure that

64
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,350
it is clean.

65
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:07,790
you don't want to get coffee grounds in
there. 

66
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,660
we will look here and

67
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,770
once we start

68
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,980
seeing some steam coming from the bottom
we'll actually start seeing coffee come

69
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:24,540
out. okay im starting to hear something going
on.

70
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,260
It's been about three minutes and

71
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,760
I don't know if you can hear it or not but you can actually
hear

72
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,490
the steam making a little racket in the bottom
of the pot down there.

73
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,170
what we ought to be seeing here just in a
minute

74
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:48,080
is some good espresso coffee coming up
through that

75
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,990
little thing in the center there. when
it does we'll have to close the top down

76
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,600
because

77
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,570
after the coffee comes out it starts

78
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,490
blowing a little bit of steam out and it'll spew
out here

79
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,990
in the kitchen. we don't want that.

80
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,610
there we go.

81
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:14,610
there comes the espresso.

82
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,410
okay.

83
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,860
in just about another minute or two it's
gonna start

84
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,440
making a little bit of chuga chuga chuga sound

85
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:39,080
and you know it's just about done.

86
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,500


87
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,110


88
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,560
I think it's about done.

89
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,740
and the way you can tell it's finished

90
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,090
is when it stops making that noise.

91
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,480
okay so it's just about that point.

92
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,420
when all the water in the bottom has
been converted into steam and that steam has

93
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,320
come up through the

94
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:26,730
coffee grounds it will be quiet.

95
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:32,300
so let's see how our bialetti espresso maker

96
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,620
actually did. Let's see what kind of espresso we got.

97
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:45,230
Looks pretty good to me.
