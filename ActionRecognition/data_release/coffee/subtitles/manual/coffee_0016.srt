11
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:29,070
These are the beans. Close the top.

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:44,200
Put the leveer in the container and grind it well.

21
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,369
No more beans.

22
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:43,570
so what

23
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:48,390
we do next. take the moka pot.

24
00:01:48,390 --> 00:02:05,940
So

25
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,080
ideally you wouldn't put water more
than

26
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,220
above this vavle.

27
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,650
There is a little rim inside. you can use that as a measure.

28
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,620
I don't know if you can see it.

29
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,400
just put little bit above it.

30
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,620
just a tiny bit.

31
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:36,500
Ideally

32
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,090
Bialetti uses this as a measure

33
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,340
for the water and you put it back.

34
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,470
I personally never use it.

35
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:52,620
Get your filter.

36
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,910
make sure that it is dry.

37
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:12,800
then you drop in your coffee.

38
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,160
so one thing you don't want to do is

39
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,360
compress it. if you

40
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,390
tamp it

41
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,800
for example you are going to have a problem

42
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,240
with the taste.

43
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,690
it's going to be bitter. the water

44
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,840
with take longer to go up

45
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,600
and you will over do the coffee. 

46
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,630
you don't want to go over the rim as well. 

47
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,940
I have a bit less.

48
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:56,210
it is OK.

49
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:00,560
but never go over. okay.

50
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,140
so

51
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:14,660
just screw it together.

52
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,750
Make it tight. Just don't screw it too tight 

53
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,020
there will be problem later. That's great.

54
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,050
put it back on the stove.

55
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,350


56
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,180
Just put it on fire.

57
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,750


58
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,970
you can leave the top opened or closed. doesn't matter.

59
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:47,090
there is this valve on the brikka. so the coffee actually doesn't 
spill out 

60
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,620
like a normal moka pot.

61
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,630
instead this here just increases the
pressure.

62
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,300
usually the moka pot

63
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,560
it will have one and a half power 

64
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,070
of pressure due to the steam that is
generated

65
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,100
at the bottom. this one because

66
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,220
of this valve should do around 

67
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,190
two, two and half. I'm not even sure about it.

68
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,640
when there is enough pressure

69
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,780
the coffee will push the

70
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,030
valve up and it would make

71
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,500
a crema park.

72
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,760
I can tell you that the crema is kind of fake. it looks nice

73
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,690
but once you put it in the glass there is not much

74
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:45,169
left to be honest. you will also see that when you put it in the glass 

75
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:54,430
it kind of gets pale.

76
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,560
the coffee will take about

77
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:09,640
three minutes.

78
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,290
Don't use an extra fine
grind

79
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,960
for the coffee. I use it a bit

80
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,280
coarse. I have it not too coarse but just a bit

81
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,910
coarse. It just goes better in my opinion.

82
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,450
I also read that it helps with the flowing.

83
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:34,380
when you see this you want to turn off

84
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:43,350
the heat.

85
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:48,499


86
00:06:48,499 --> 00:06:50,879
okay it looks nice.

87
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,629
I'm going to pour it.
