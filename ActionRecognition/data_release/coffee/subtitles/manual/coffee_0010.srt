33
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:09,500


34
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,220


35
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,640


36
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,980


37
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,860
now what i do is I put this object here.

38
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,790
I'm going to take one of my tablespoons that I use for my

39
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,900
espresso macine.

40
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:38,290
I can use a different one but this one is a bit easier to
use.

41
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:45,720
Then I'm going to take that, pour it here.

42
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,400


43
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,490
I have a couple of skills that 

44
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:57,260
I use but I don't use them for

45
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,500
coffee.

46
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,240
I don't really use them at all.

47
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,090
I like to think that human imperfection in things 

48
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,090
actually

49
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:16,630
makes things taste better.

50
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,300
I'm gonna add anothe spoon here I think.
That's not too much.

51
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,560
you know when I got this moka pot it said 

52
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,160
you're not supposed to tamp it down and I have a tamper for
my espresso machine

53
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,239
that i use.

54
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,160


55
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,599


56
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,930
This is the tamper.

57
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,690


58
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,090


59
00:01:52,090 --> 00:02:03,709


60
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:09,930


61
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,770


62
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,040


63
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,079
now I'm putting this on the range.

64
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:25,660


65
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,940


66
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,490
for me because you're not

67
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,370
supposed to let it sit on the heat for
too long

68
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,180
what I do is when i hear burbling, I

69
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,080
open up the lid to see if it's pouring out then
I turn the heat off the moment

70
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,480
it stops going out and starts to
get 

71
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,290
fizzy sort of. 

72
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,090

73
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,520
so welcome back.

74
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,490
you can see the coffee is pouring in.

75
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:13,760
now as it reaches that mark 

76
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,520
I go ahead and turn the heat off.

77
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,350
there we go.

78
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:26,020
It does smell kind of like chocolate.

79
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:31,150
I'm going to go get a cup.

80
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,199


81
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,919
so the problem with this

82
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,290
moka pot is that it starts to leak

83
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,770
when I pour coffee

84
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:51,169
from it. I'm gonna get two cups.

85
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:57,600
That's about a half cup. we'll just add more later.
