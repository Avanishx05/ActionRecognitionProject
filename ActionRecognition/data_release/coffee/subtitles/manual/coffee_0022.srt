12
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,200
so we are going to add the water in now. probably about three fourths of 

13
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,160
the way. that's good. the second part is the filter and

14
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,220
this is where the ground espresso goes. you only want to use

15
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,230
ground espresso. if you try to use ground coffee

16
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,780
the taste will be very different and very weak.

17
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,020
you don't want that. you really want to use the espresso. It's a 
stronger

18
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,790
coffee roast. so we go ahead and pack that lightly.

19
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,909
I like my brew strong so I am going to put

20
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:39,090
a little bit more in and we go ahead and add that.

21
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,630
now the top part is called the upper chamber which has a stem. 

22
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,330
now what happens is the water will boil from the bottom and

23
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,409
go through the ground espresso

24
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:52,490
and will come right up into this upper chamber. that's where we pour it from.

25
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,619
so we go ahead and put the top on.

26
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:59,920
you want to make sure that you screw it very tightly.

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,100
we don't want any water to leak out from the

28
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,320
sides. then we put it on the edge of the burner and

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,900
turn it to high. now this is a glass stovetop and you can use this on any stovetop

30
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,330
but if you are using a 

31
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,080
gas stovetop, you want to have it more towards the center.

32
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,290
if that's a problem because of your opening

33
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:27,530
you can purchase like plates that sit right on top

34
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,290
and allow you to put something without having to worry about it tipping in. so we are going to give this just a few minutes to heat up.

35
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,159
we'll hear it boiling and our espresso will be ready.

36
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:40,159
I can tell our espresso is done.

37
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,279
it stopped making the boiling noise. so i want to turn this off.

38
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:47,529
now keep in mind why i said to put this on the edge of the burner.

39
00:01:47,529 --> 00:01:51,549
I can touch this handle, it's not hot. so it keeps it away from the heat.

40
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:54,959
if that's not possible with your type of stove

41
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,840
use an oven mitt or a pot holder to protect your hand

42
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,359
and simply move it to another burner.

43
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:05,559
let it sit and cool just for a minute or so or just pour it right away.

44
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:08,629
make sure you are protecting your hand. we wanna go ahead and pour this 

45
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:12,019
right into our espresso cups. hope you found this

46
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:16,230
video useful. now you know how to use a stovetop espresso maker.
