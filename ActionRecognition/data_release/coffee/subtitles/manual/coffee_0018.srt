31
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:09,930
you have water in here which you fill up to the valve till right about there.

32
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:15,549
you don't want to go over.

33
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:19,510
then the coffee holder

34
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,670
holds the coffee right above that.

35
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,870
you will notice it has lots of little holes.

36
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:30,060
so what happens when the water starts
boiling the steam pressure makes it go up

37
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,049
through the coffee.

38
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:37,280
even though

39
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,630
this is the coffee we're gonna use I've got
some already opened

40
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,440
in a container. the thing is once you open this
these are vaccum packed

41
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,769
bricks by the way. and you can get these
almost anywhere these days.

42
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:54,470


43
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:59,440
it goes on sale a lot.

44
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,750
But i have got some.

45
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,190
this is not Maxwell House crash rose but

46
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:11,070
you need to have some spoons or some sort of

47
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,109
way of getting it in here.

48
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:18,120
a coffee scoop works fine and

49
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,220
you need to fill this up.

50
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:30,590
it is not so important to tamp it down
as it is with some other fancier

51
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,250
machines.

52
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,959
some of the really

53
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,540
fancy machines like you get a restaurant
often they're made in Italy and

54
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,549
they rely on steam pressure but they are

55
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:46,590
pump driven. pump

56
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,190
gives you consistent steam pressure but
they also cost a lot.

57
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,229
so I am gonna tamp it down a little bit.

58
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:58,930
don't work my hands are clean.

59
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,120
I just washed them. that looks good.

60
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,530
then put the top on coz what happens is
when the

61
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:17,169
steam pressure goes through the coffee
grounds it comes out here at the top.

62
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:22,500
it comes down

63
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,199
and so after a little while you want
this

64
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:29,680
to be shut. but for some time you want to

65
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,520
see it come out and that's an
important part of doing this.

66
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,220
once you screw the top on here you want to leave it open so you can see when it first starts to come up.

67
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,300
I need to point out that this is the

68
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,759
three cup size. you can
get these

69
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,370
for anywhere from

70
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,590
six to ten dollars. depending on where you pick them up.

71
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,650
they come in different sizes.
this is the nine cup size.

72
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,210
I found this one

73
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,800
at bloom for eight dollars.

74
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,280
what a deal. this one

75
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,159
holds more. they may come up to 12 and I
think 15 cup size as well.

76
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:15,930
they make these small. the three cup size is about the best.
I have to point out that

77
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,960
I had to fix this because the handle

78
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,550
was about to break off. so I use a little
clamp.

79
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,930
gotta do what you gotta do. it

80
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,460
is not the best way but it works. now

81
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,870
an important part of this is the sugar. since this is the

82
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,939
three cup size we put in 3 spoonfuuls of sugar.

83
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:42,580
obviously if you have a sweet tooth
you could put in more

84
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,469
or if you don't like sugar you could do without it.

85
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:49,810
but i don't think it will be real cuban coffee.

86
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,740
it will be espresso but not cafe cubano.

87
00:03:54,740 --> 00:04:02,249
okay. so you got the sugar.

88
00:04:02,249 --> 00:04:05,469
then when you are ready put it on the

89
00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:08,810
flame or stovetop. this is a gas

90
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:14,439
stovetop which is really much better
because it's easier to control what you are doing.

91
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:17,729
you can use electric but it gets a little difficult.

92
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:22,159
there we go.

93
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:26,749
it helps if you turn on the right one.

94
00:04:26,749 --> 00:04:31,169
okay. so now we got the flame going.

95
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:34,310
so this next step is really important as it has to

96
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,939
do with the timiing. while we are waiting for the

97
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:41,909
coffee to come up because the steam pressure
is gonna bring it to the

98
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:46,849
top, you wanna have some

99
00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:50,330
cups ready. these are demi task cups.

100
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,560


101
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,229
this does about 3 this size. maybe little small.

102
00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:01,680
you also have them like this. anything
smaller than

103
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,180
a regular coffee cup. in just a few seconds we're gonna see
the first batch and this is

104
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,029
really important.

105
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:14,789
now at this point when coffee
first starts to come up its just a little bit

106
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:15,900
thicker.

107
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,430
right about there you close this and then
you put just a little bit in the sugar.

108
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,919
maybe about a quarter size. that's about
right.

109
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:28,159
put it back on the flame so it will continue brewing.

110
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:32,650
then you stir this up. this is the
secret.

111
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,039
this is what makes it look and taste like that.

112
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,400
fancy cup that you would

113
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,889
get from your favorite barista.

114
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:49,259


115
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:55,259
it gets to a kind of a paste.

116
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:59,400
if you want or if you have friends waiting
for this you can make

117
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:06,110
gurgling noises so they think you have an expensive machine
for the time necessary.

118
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:11,750
now this will start gurgling here

119
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,120
in a second. we'll see the steam

120
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:24,800
coming out. you can hear it.

121
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,180
it is just about ready.

122
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,409
I don't want to open this now. it will

123
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:37,140
be like mount vasuvius. okay.

124
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,560
it's ready.

125
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,200
pour it in here. keep stirring.
