19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
You can use tap water or filter water, whatever you prefer. you wanna make sure you fill it right below or right on the valve on the side of the

20
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:06,680
pot.

21
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,860
then we place that funnel looking thing
that I probably should know what it's

22
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,750
called in English

23
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:15,180
and place it inside the Pot. after that we
put our coffee inside the pot.

24
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,360
you can either make a little mountain
like I am doing, depressing the coffee in

25
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,119
while we screw the top part on

26
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,420
or you can compress it as you put it in.

27
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,340
then we screw on the top as tight as we
can to make sure to coffee won't come out

28
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,290
from the side.

29
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,549
we simply put it on the stove over low heat
to prevent the coffee from burning

30
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,579
because that would suck. you will have to make
the coffee all over again while the 

31
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:37,689
pot is still burning hot

32
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:43,280
and that is no fun.

33
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,229


34
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:53,600
then you just have to wait five or six
minutes until you see the coffee

35
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,390
starting to come out from the holes
inside the pot.

36
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,390


37
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:05,160


38
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,619


39
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,909
