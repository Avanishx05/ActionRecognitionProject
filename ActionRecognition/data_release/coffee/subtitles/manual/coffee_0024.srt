6
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:05,330
so once after having added the water, just put the coffee in.
I do oen scoop for one person.

7
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:10,050
now you can just tamp it down but it is really
important just to get an even spread

8
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,130
in packing down the coffee. you can use a spoon or a scoop as in this case.

9
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,969
justgoing to put the lid back on.

10
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:22,100
it's important here to make sure that you
screw it on nice and tightly

11
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,100
without any leaks. that way any pressure
build-up will go right through your freshly brewed coffee.

12
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,360


13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,559
we don't want too much heat on the stove. just enough to

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,899
start it boiling up. one trick you can do is add
boiling water

15
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:41,930
when you are filling it up. it will speed up the
process.

16
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,629
this will take about five minutes.

17
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:52,450
so nw you will hear the freshly brewed coffee.
it is coming out of the top os the stovetop espresso.

18
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,100
now it's all finished.

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,689
now it's just time to pour freshly brewed coffee.
