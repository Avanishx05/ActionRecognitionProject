44
00:00:08,739 --> 00:00:10,680
if you fill it above the valve. does that cause an issue?

45
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,760
they just recommend not to just for

46
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,019
safety reasons. if

47
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:22,229
you over heat it with the valve submerged
it may not open properly and release the pressure.

48
00:00:22,229 --> 00:00:24,099
okay.

49
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:26,169
then you insert your basket

50
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:27,539
and

51
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,219
add your coffee.

52
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:32,119
we are using lavazza crema gusto

53
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,869
traditional

54
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:37,619
european stove top

55
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:42,969
espresso blend. what's
the grind like compared to an espresso. the grind is 

56
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:44,319
not

57
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:46,359
quite as fine as the espresso 

58
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,879
grind but you want it

59
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:50,119
a little finer than what we use for

60
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,930
drip coffee.

61
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,400
so somewhere in the middle like a fine drip.

62
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,149
that would work

63
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:02,189
just fine. dandy.

64
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:05,169


65
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:07,299
one downside with the

66
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:11,889
stovetop units is

67
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:14,099
you have to make it to capacity.

68
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:17,089
you can't make a short

69
00:01:17,089 --> 00:01:18,589
pot.

70
00:01:18,589 --> 00:01:22,279
so i couldn't say it's just
me so i was going to put enough coffee

71
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:28,439
and water in for one shot. the
one stove top maker we offer that does

72
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,619
give you some options

73
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:33,279
that's the ilsa.

74
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:36,649
that this guy here. it is 

75
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:40,949
unique in that the basket

76
00:01:40,949 --> 00:01:43,740
comes with a little insert. so you can

77
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,659
either fill it full

78
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,210
or you can put the insert in and half fill it

79
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:52,260
and use half as much water.
so it's a little more flexible.

80
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,460
right. okay.

81
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,860


82
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,570
because this is going to form sort of a puck
like an espresso machine

83
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,620
just filling one of these half with water

84
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,680
is not really gonna work because


85
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,960
because the coffee is going to be pushed up
against this screen. so it's half full

86
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,699
it's not gonna get

87
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:12,979
pushed against the screen.

88
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:16,939
and uh... basically do you need that as
sort of like a pressure element with the

89
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:20,689
building up that steam and getting that water through.

90
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:25,599
got it.

91
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,009
nice thing about

92
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:31,389
these stovetop units is they
basically last forever.

93
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:34,300
the only wear item is the gasket.

94
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,840
my wife and i have been using the
same gasket for over a year now.

95
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,419
a fair amount of use. short of

96
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:45,669
you know breaking the plastic handle

97
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:49,120
there is nothing to go wrong with these.

98
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,790
so before we start this guy

99
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:56,449
we just have a few models. this
is specifically the musa which is

100
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:57,769
the brushed.

101
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:01,189
then there's the venus which is the shiny.

102
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:04,409
then the elsa models that you were talking about.

103
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:06,310
overhear we have the bottom

104
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,580
chamber which is double walled.

105
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,619
they do have a double wall for more heat retention.

106
00:03:14,619 --> 00:03:17,759


107
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,729
okay then this of course is the
bialetti

108
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:25,979
moka pot. the original one.
made of aluminum but it's chrome

109
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:29,080
plated aluminum so you're not going to
get

110
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,899
nasty health effects.

111
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:33,769

112
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:37,749
this is the one that a lot of people are
familiar with. 

113
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:41,039
I think this might be the original design.

114
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,819


115
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:46,360
it's on display at the museum of modern art.
it's iconic.

116
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,350
and then this is the

117
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,610
the bialetti moka express

118
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:55,660
which is the combination of a moka stovetop espresso maker and a milk frother.

119
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,310


120
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,520
if you add your milk here
it will actually use some of the

121
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,669
steam to push through the milk.

122
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:02,620

123
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:08,220
so does it combine the coffee and the mil together then. yes. okay. 

124
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:16,019
it's the one touch of a stovetop espresso maker.

125
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,419

126
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:22,590
okay so we are going to start this guy and it does take a while to get it going.

127
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,319
so i think we'll probably
just get it going and then come back when it's up to

128
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:29,909
temp. 

129
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:33,169


130
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:35,989
one nice thing about this is it tells
you when it starts working. it's gonna

131
00:04:35,989 --> 00:04:38,889
make noise. so we will

132
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:41,860
wait for it to start gurgling. ok we'll be
right back.

133
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,759

134
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:46,860
it's starting its little magic. you can see the steam coming out. it's gurgling, it's

135
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,960
steaming, it's doing its thing.

136
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,319
now with the bigger ones you wanna leave
them on the heat a little bit longer. but generally

137
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,099
once it starts gurgling and the coffee starts
coming out you can actually cut

138
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:58,219
the heat off.

139
00:04:58,219 --> 00:05:01,990
just let it do it's own thing.

140
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,030


141
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,039
if you kept going would that burn
the coffee then because it was too much heat.

142
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,419
yeah. 

143
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:11,550
because at that point you are heating the upper craft too that the coffee is in and

144
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,150
you can get an off flavour from too much temperature.
can we look at it or do we need to keep the 

145
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,899
pressure.

146
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:20,520
you can see the coffee spouting out.

147
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,449


148
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,140
you see it's a nice

149
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,640
thick brew but without the 
sort of greedy nature of french

150
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:34,170
press. you can throw one of these
across the room which you can't with the

151
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,379
french press without it breaking.

152
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:40,270
well there are metal ones now these
days. 

153
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:48,889

154
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:53,560
what is your favorite. do you drink it
straight or do you add what water to it.

155
00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:00,460
i genereally drink it straight. the
six cup size which is this size here will

156
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,270
fill one regular american coffee mug. so

157
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,139
size accordingly if you want two people
to have two good strong cups of coffee

158
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:09,229
for

159
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:12,370
dragging themselves out of a
stooper in the morning. 

160
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,750


161
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,440
if you want to make 

162
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,450
one american size cup at a time the six cup would be better.

163
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:23,780
you can mix it with hot

164
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:30,810
water or with hot milk. you can make a cafe au lait or cafe

165
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,230
americano so to speak.

166
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:43,450
now it's really going. even though the heat is off you can see it's really doing its business. the magic of steam pressure

167
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:48,370
discovered by archimedes thousands of years ago

168
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:54,020
now finally put to good use.

169
00:06:54,020 --> 00:07:00,990
totally because when
they were using just like trains 

170
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:05,380
powered by steam that was just
ridiculous. i mean that was just not a

171
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,530
good application.

172
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,010


173
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,480


174
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:19,709
okay i will trust you on that one. i will let you edit yourself.

175
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:24,680
so you just hang out until
it stops spuritng anymore.

176
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:33,010
the heat is off.

177
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:41,180

178
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,090

179
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,850

180
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:52,290
we are done brewing. Got a nice brew here. And actually I should mention in 

181
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:55,730
Italy it is common to use sparkling water

182
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,580
in the fill and you get a bit of
crema to it.

183
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,880
we definitely need to try it out.

184
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,110


185
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,530


186
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,480
that's very nice brew.

187
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,290
It's obviously not true espresso but you can
just tell by the color that it's more than just coffee.
