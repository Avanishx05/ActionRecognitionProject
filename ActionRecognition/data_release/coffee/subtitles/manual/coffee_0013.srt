11
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:07,070
You fill it up and after you do that, you grind the coffee.
I pick the Brazil Esperanca

12
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,600
coffee that we have because
brazilian coffees are sweeter and they

13
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,690
tend to be more forgiving in the moka pot.

14
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,739
Canion coffees are going to be a
little bit more earthier and a little bit

15
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:17,579
more vegital.

16
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:21,149
they don't normally work. for just boiling in the moka pot
I like coffees that are

17
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:21,770
sweeter.

18
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,899
at home when I grind my coffee I just
look in my

19
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:28,320
little tiny coffee grinder that I have
and grind it to 

20
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,510
somewhere finer than what would be a
paper filter.

21
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:35,159
this guy goes inside here. you
actually want that kind of full.

22
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,860
everybody doesn't have these at their
house probably even though we do because we

23
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,320
are espresso Dorks.

24
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,439
if you don't then you just use a spoon and you press
it down as fast as you can.

25
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,720
so that it's basically even and you can tap the side of it
to make it even. you want to put the top

26
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,640
back on here

27
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,780
but you want to use a towel so you don't burn your little
fingers. so you just grab it and you twist the top on.

28
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,850
then it goes on here and you
turn the volume back up again

29
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,820
and wait untill the pot starts to make funny
little noises called the first sneeze

30
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,110
or something. when it starts making noises you 
know that it is

31
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,460
sucking the coffee up.

32
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,600
it might take a while on this contraption.

33
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,119
while you're waiting you can play with
your knives. try not to burn the

34
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:15,720
handle

35
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,930
while waiting for it to boil. it's starting to get there
kind of.

36
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,439
if you're using a gas stove

37
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,110
it does not take this long.

38
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:35,330


39
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:35,930
It's starting

40
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,349
to do a bubbling thing. you can see the steam coming out
of it and so you really wanna turn it off.

41
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:43,880
actually take it off of the heat. all the liquid is 
gonna come up into the top

42
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,630
part of the moka pot. you're gonna have coffee in it.
it's going to be

43
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,380
really strong thick coffee that's not
grainy like

44
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,200
French press coffee and it's going to be very
good if you did it the right way.

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,150
it makes two normal size cups of coffee or one giant size cup of coffee.
