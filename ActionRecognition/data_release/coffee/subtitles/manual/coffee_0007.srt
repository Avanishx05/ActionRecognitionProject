with a pressure release valve. for maximum safety
stay close to your coffeemaker 

24
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,630
while it's brewing. As the water is

25
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,440
heating, pressure is building up in the
lower chamber forcing the water up the

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,869
filter funnel and into the upper chamber.
