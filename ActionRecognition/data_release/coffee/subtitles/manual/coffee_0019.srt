6
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:07,940
take our water, pour it right in.

7
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,520
just below the hinge as I said. now cubans

8
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,750
like their coffee really really strong. so we're going to take
this.

9
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,969
your favorite espresso. you cna use pilon or

10
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:23,000
whatever you find in your local grocery
stores. take a spoon

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,070
and you are gonna want to fill it very very genereously.

12
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:33,600
usually cubans actually pat their coffee down. so use your spoon and pat it down.

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,859
you pretty much want to fill it all the way to the top.

14
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:40,970
this makes about 4 cups

15
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,010
so it's gonna be about four tablespoons or so of coffee.

16
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,400
but as i said you want to make sure you fill it right up 

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:55,490
and pat the coffee down.

18
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:01,150
then we're gonna close our espresso.

19
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,530
now it's really important

20
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,700
you put it on the smallest burner and when you
turn it on you want to

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,200
have the handle towards you so that
it doesn't get really hot as well.

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,270
alright

23
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,860
so you're gonna turn your stove on not too high to about 8 or 9.

24
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,510
then what we are actually gonna do is we are gonna take

25
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,110
some sugar in order to make some foam.

26
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:28,160
now here's what you really want to watch.
once you see the first

27
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,090
little bit of coffee you are gonna want to basically mix it. now

28
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,430
cubans like their coffee pretty sweet too. so it's gonna be about 4 teaspoons since we are making about 4 cups of coffee.

29
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,580
so you fill it in this little

30
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:48,620
bowl. then you watch the coffee and
make sure that once you see the first little bit of

31
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,530
coffee we arejust gonna pour it in there and mix it.
that is actually gonna be our foam.

32
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:58,140
so let's watch. once it starts making that noise

33
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,250
you pour a little bit in. so gonna pour that out. just that first little bit to make our foam.

34
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,800
put it back.

35
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,880
meanwhile we are gonna

36
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:18,460
mix our sugar with that first little bit of coffee.

37
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,370
so you see it kind of makes a little creamy like brown milky consistency.

38
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,400
then we are just gonna add the coffee right in there.

39
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,340
so it's gonna be really good.

40
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,680
so once that's done we are just gonna turn the oven off.

41
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,410
safety first. then we're gonna take the 

42
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,430
coffee pour into our little foamy sugar
mixture. careful you don't want to burn yourself.
