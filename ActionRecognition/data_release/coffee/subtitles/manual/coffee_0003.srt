47
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,590
okay so as you see here I have the bottom
portion filled with water already.

48
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,100
you just slip this this middle portion
inside.

49
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,550
I'm going to get my first ground coffee.
which today is the

50
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,140
ethiopia saddama natural from social.
this

51
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,950
brewing method really brings out the
very flavour out of this

52
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,550
coffee. and it just really

53
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,950
highlights the great flavors about it.

54
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,240
I push it down slightly as

55
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,600
I'm putting it in here. level it off so that

56
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,240
you can have even extraction throughout the basket.

57
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,170
so I am just levelling.

58
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,350
and it's really important to make sure
you don't have any

59
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,340
grounds around this outside edge. so that it
doesn't get screwed down and

60
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,370
and block 

61
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,680
the seal. now here's a little tip that
I wanna show you.

62
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,890
just put an extra amount there

63
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,230
in the center. that will help with
creating more pressure

64
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:10,500
and it brews a nice rich pot
this way.

65
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,600
so there we have it. It's clean around the edges.

66
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:20,539
you just simply screw down this top.

67
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:26,069
ok make sure it's nice and secure

68
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:29,599
so that the pressure builds up and
the water doesn't shoot up

69
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:39,120
out of the sides there like that. that's not what you want. so
you just sit there and let this brew.

70
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,830
use a medium heat.

71
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:51,270
so in about five to six minutes, the coffee will be ready.

72
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,749
okay so as you can see the coffee is
starting to brew now.

73
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:58,419
you can see how just how rich that
is.

74
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:02,509
so what I recommend is that while you are
brewing your coffee that

75
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:07,020
you actually boil a kettle as well
because this is

76
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,279
like double strength. then you can
you can drink it that way if that's

77
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:12,080
how you prefer.

78
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,169
but most people like to mix it
half and half with

79
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,760
some hot water.

80
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:32,450


81
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,650
after the brewing is complete

82
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:39,270
fill your mug to about halfway up.

83
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,060
Take your kettle and fill with water to the desired strength.
