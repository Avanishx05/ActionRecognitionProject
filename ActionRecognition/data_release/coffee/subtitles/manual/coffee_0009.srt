15
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,430

16
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,960
That's probably enough.

17
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,430
now I set my coffee grinder to

18
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,120
espresso. which is a very fine

19
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:22,030
setting.

20
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:37,050
top off. coffee in.

21
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,000
the grinder

22
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,329
makes a nice even grind.

23
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:52,740
It's good enough to make espresso.

24
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:59,220


25
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:10,400


26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:29,940


27
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:37,890


28
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:45,040
Tamp it down just to smooth it over.

29
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,040


30
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,430


31
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,060


32
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,900
so this can screw on tightly.

33
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:07,920


34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,430
there we go.

35
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:19,269
turn the burner on high. put that
there.

36
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:22,640
it'll take a couple of minutes to start boiling.

37
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,650


38
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,819
what happens is, it's not a percolator. the
water

39
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,849
turns to steam down here and is forced up


40
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:35,980
through the filter and then up

41
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,290
through this little hole under there

42
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:46,220
and off the top and it fills up the top of
the pot. it makes a very strong

43
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,420
cup of coffee. it tastes a lot like espresso.

44
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:55,810


45
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:21,740
I'm going to stop it right here and come back.

46
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:28,590
the water is not boiling yet.

47
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,310
it even let's it cream up like 
real espresso.

48
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,320
similar process it is just that the pressure
isn't quite as much as a

49
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:49,440
 real espresso machine.

50
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,660
I'm gonna close this coz when it starts to
boil, steam comes out the top

51
00:03:53,660 --> 00:04:10,490
and it makes a mess.

52
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:16,230
You can hear it boiling now.

53
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,270
Better take it off the burner.
