9
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,380
to set that aside and we're gonna fill
up the water

10
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,719
so weird me using three hundred forty
milliliters of water

11
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,240
on this particular mock apart a man that
just comes

12
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,250
right under the released I'll

13
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:25,950
you can use any outside and may have
just been a little too much

14
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,200
Gio right now that we have that sets

15
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,479
can do is worth just gonna set that
water

16
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,899
it sits at the base side i right

17
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:42,330
and now will prepare culture so

18
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,229
to prepare the filter we're going to be
using 26 grams of coffee

19
00:00:46,229 --> 00:01:06,849
I'm just way that out all rights

20
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:12,209
love shopping around but the next things
up

21
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:17,030
is we are going to set our grinder and
for the most part I suggest a crime that

22
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,590
is

23
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,840
the slightly finer than drip

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,030
so on this key

25
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,319
and Cap'n for them using here that's
about one number

26
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:53,160
ring loader lower than trip

27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,430
as you'll notice here

28
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,980
a grand directly into the basket much
like you do first press 0

29
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,740
I'm granite directly into the
portafilter I'm just be careful how much

30
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,849
you settle

31
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:09,510
because it can be easily fit a lot more
than 26 grams in the basket to depends

32
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,739
on how hard to settle

33
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,860
so may look a little bit deceptively
low: and

34
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,650
a.m. you notice important reminder
although it looks kind of like the

35
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,330
basket

36
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,900
espresso machine do not tampered

37
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,660
a mocha audit not designed to deal with

38
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,790
a pocket that's that is that dance it'll
actually

39
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,830
you tap it has a good chance to have a
popping the relief well

40
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,890
so now that we have

41
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,730
are coffee all set and we have the mocha
part reassembled

42
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,519
we will get ready to set it up

43
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:52,299
so just the turn the heat up too high
for using a stovetop burner than

44
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:57,450
it's probably going to be medium
medium-high and waiting at the clock

45
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,790
okay so now we have a top view so this
total process should take about five

46
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,220
minutes

47
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,140
start to finish depending on how fast
takes your water to heat up

48
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,200
so we're actually gonna go ahead and
skip

49
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,920
towards the end so this is about four
minutes 45 seconds now into it

50
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,540
and we're gonna see that the CAF is
beginning to come out so

51
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,670
right as the coffee beans to come out I
like to lower the heat to about fifty

52
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,720
percent of what it was

53
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,049
so for me it's Lauren it from hyde
medium would run the stovetop the maybe

54
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:32,550
from medium-high to medium-low

55
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,120
something like that and more to do is
worth the wait

56
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,800
as it approaches the as it approaches
the

57
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,110
very base the spout and right as it hits
the base the spout were gonna turn off

58
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:53,870
the heat all together

59
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,890
so it's right about now right at the
beginning at the spout and so

60
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:03,160
turning off the heat and the residual
heat is actually gonna carry this a

61
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,790
extraction all the way to the end the
reason to Lauren heat is that we really

62
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,760
don't want

63
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,370
it to be burst the water to be bursting
out at the bottom from start to finish

64
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,840
really wanna kinda temper that he didn't
temperature pressure because remember

65
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,020
trauma he is also I'm patrolling p
pressure in the rate at which the

66
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,610
water's coming from bomb if the heat is
on full blast

67
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,930
whole way through that I'll definitely
be splattering out so

68
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,300
now that we're finished we're gonna go
ahead and

69
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,550
poor the mocha part so if you're using a
stovetop burner

70
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,760
assertion electric one you might wanna
take it act of the actual bernard has it

71
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,170
will continue to

72
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:43,290
keep them occupied even after somebody's
gonna go ahead and poor

73
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,500
for sport carefully especially if I
pouring from a
