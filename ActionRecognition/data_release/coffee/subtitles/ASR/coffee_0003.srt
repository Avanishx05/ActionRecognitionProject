47
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,590
okay so as you see here have a bottom
portion filled with water already

48
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,100
you just swiftest this middle course
inside

49
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,550
I'll come and get my first round think
which today is the

50
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,140
ethiopia saddam a natural from social
this

51
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,950
are brewing method really brings out the
very cleaver out this

52
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,550
coffee and it just rearm a

53
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,950
highlights the great flavors about it

54
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,240
of course without a slightly Anza

55
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,600
according leveling off so her

56
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,240
here even extraction throughout basket

57
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,170
so I just left wing

58
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,350
and it's really important to make sure
you don't have any

59
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,340
any grounds runs outside edge so that it
doesn't get screwed down and

60
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,370
and block yes

61
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,680
the sea or now here's a little tip that
I wanna show you

62
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,890
just put an extra amount there

63
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,230
and the center that will help without
creating more pressure

64
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:10,500
and I'm yeppers a nice which part of
this way

65
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,600
so their habits clean around the edges

66
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:20,539
and he just simply screw down to stop

67
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:26,069
ok make sure it's nice and secure

68
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:29,599
so that the pressure builds up and
doesn't in the water doesn't shoot up

69
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:39,120
sides are ok that's not what you want so
you just sit there and what this Brewer

70
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,830
and I'm user a medium heat

71
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:51,270
so what time is six meses copy will be
rare ho

72
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,749
case which you can see the coffee is
turning to Bruno

73
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:58,419
I'm you can see how just how rich that
is

74
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:02,509
so we recommend is that while you were
burning your coffee that

75
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:07,020
you actually I boil a kettle as well
because this is

76
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,279
like double strength and then you can
you can drink it that way if that's

77
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:12,080
safer for

78
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,169
five-time most people like to mix it
happen half with

79
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,760
some hot water

80
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:32,450
dubbed

81
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,650
after the bridge complete

82
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:39,270
with that beautiful rich cafe to your
mother about halfway up

83
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,060
think your cattle
