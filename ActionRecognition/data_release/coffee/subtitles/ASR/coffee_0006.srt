19
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,040
you wanna make sure you fill a right
below or right on the bubble decided to

20
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:06,680
pop

21
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,860
them replace the final looking thing
that I probably should know what it's

22
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,750
called in English

23
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:15,180
and placed inside a Pok after that we
put our coffee inside the pot

24
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,360
you can either make a little mountain
bike am doing compressing the copy and

25
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,119
it will use to the top part on

26
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,420
are you compress it as you put it in

27
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,340
then was cool on the top as tight as we
can to make sure to copy or come out

28
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,290
from the side

29
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,549
and we simply put on sto over low heat
to prevent the copied from burning

30
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,579
because that woodstock you have to make
the copy all over again while the I

31
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:37,689
still burning hot

32
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:43,280
and that is no fun up

33
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,229
model

34
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:53,600
then you just have to wait five or six
minutes until you see the coffee

35
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,390
starting to come out from the holes
inside the park

36
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,390
the to

37
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:05,160
local vo

38
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,619
are

39
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,909
little
