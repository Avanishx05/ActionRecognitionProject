10
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,930
dole just underneath the CFL input
filter

11
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:11,539
on top I'll next

12
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:18,620
fill the filter with expresso grounds
the car usually loosely packed to the

13
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,889
top of the filter

14
00:00:19,889 --> 00:00:23,190
being careful not to overfill per pack
too hard

15
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,059
if you do back at your heart your pot
may be in danger of exploding

16
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:31,469
or we might just wait for her and no
coffee look here

17
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:36,070
authors step is just screw the top of
the coffee pot

18
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,140
I firmly once you've done that

19
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:52,060
place this on the heat

20
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,710
make sure the plastic and all is not too
close to the heat source

21
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,420
I'm going to label it out for a little
bit you can see where the party starts

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,080
to brew

23
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,220
that is probably better just leave it
down

24
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:16,190
in real life in order to avoid bills

25
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,860
fail to express

26
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,890
all through anything so hot months ago I
suggest not using the old record

27
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,970
for your free trader my expresso to call

28
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:32,119
sprouts 3 5 dry

29
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:33,100
thanks for joining
