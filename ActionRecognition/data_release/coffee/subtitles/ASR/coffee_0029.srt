6
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,169
simply fill the bottom chambre the
espresso maker with water

7
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:11,829
up to the line them but the
funnel-shaped filter in place

8
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:23,640
on top of the bottom chamber and fill it
with brown coffee

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,830
the next step is to screw the top part
of the plat

10
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,550
onto the bottom part and what's your
heat source is ready

11
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,000
in this case a burner for campaign place
the espresso maker

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,200
over it once the water is sufficiently
hot

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,430
it creates I pressure in the bottom
chamber

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,640
first itself a the final and through the
coffee grounds

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,710
splurging brewed coffee into the top
timbre

16
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,780
as you can see when all that is done
