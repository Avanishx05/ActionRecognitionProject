85
00:00:00,409 --> 00:00:01,300
anybody

86
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,539
a who use these in Italy who created the
water

87
00:00:04,539 --> 00:00:09,909
I'm so the water just gets added Roger
Lee cold water just get added to the

88
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:15,389
bottom reservoir I'm the the manual that
comes with this will say something about

89
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:19,180
filling water into you get to the
registration marks or to the water level

90
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:19,960
marks

91
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,169
I'm just as someone who spent what i'm
looking for them there are no such marks

92
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:28,759
I was trying to do is you after all the
water just up to below where the valve

93
00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:30,849
is so just under the valve by

94
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:35,090
like a centimeter so I'm if you don't
have a valve in america pock

95
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:40,189
I endured during soar want to use anyway
I'm the way to see how often forget the

96
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:44,310
water is to make sure that no water
intrudes into

97
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,870
this funnel-shaped grounds comb

98
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,639
when it's inserted all the way singer
following the side and see about where

99
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:54,090
the bottom of this

100
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,860
this %uh followers are pop it inside to
make sure that

101
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,919
no water comes up through

102
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:04,460
this song this filter colour filter
funnel

103
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,639
and that's how much water should have as
much as you can get in without intruding

104
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:08,759
into this

105
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:14,400
I to fill this once again probably the
ideal would be

106
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,449
freshly ground locally roasted are
firstly roasted coffee

107
00:01:18,449 --> 00:01:21,650
I'm grounded something less than an
espresso grind

108
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:27,330
to the grind for this the proper grind
is finer than a filter coffee ground

109
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,020
crying and and not as fine as an
espresso grind

110
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,189
if you get to find that's really get
problems with an overpressure situation

111
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:39,419
in the the bottom part although like I
said I've I've never actually seen that

112
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:39,969
and I've

113
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:43,650
stop these things for coffee many times
absurd to fill this

114
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,060
are you take your your copy which is
percent not quite as per se ground you

115
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,430
don't want to be caking

116
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:54,129
as a surly and you feel this more coffee
for thermal coffee filter

117
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:57,539
all the way to the top I actually

118
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:01,169
even fill it slightly over the top

119
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:04,800
I misusing Lovatt sup fine ground

120
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,610
a espresso coffee in a cam from the
store

121
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,409
are that is pretty much what everyone in
me pose used

122
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:16,610
are they would use Kimbo which is a big
local brand everyone liked

123
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,319
I'm every now and then you to use when
using tule aren't you he was probably

124
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:25,129
you know the the premier are that the
premium coffee

125
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:30,039
was also from up north and so cabin or
sell thing going on Italy where

126
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:35,029
no here southerners didn't are cater to
the northern parts quite as much in so

127
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:38,069
the local brands over camber were from a
comment

128
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:42,469
and then I just loosely packed this now
I'm not to camping at

129
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:46,150
I'm not packing it like you would
espresso I just don't want to get all

130
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,740
over the map

131
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,990
rubber gasket here so

132
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,039
this loosely Camperdown you screw the

133
00:02:54,039 --> 00:03:00,330
top reservoir on up

134
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,849
really tight and it goes right honey

135
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:06,930
burner on the stove I'm this is our

136
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,249
my caster has a very high flame so
actually set slightly off-center

137
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:14,860
so that the plastic handle doesn't get

138
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,189
enough for forces the flame and then you
want

139
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:21,849
whatever medium a flame on this

140
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:26,199
are you don't wanna just torture I
because that will just

141
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:29,759
serve worsen the problem about this top

142
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,340
was working really hard and cooking the
coffee

143
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,590
now we're going to %uh put this on the
burner and what will happen is the water

144
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,249
in the bottom or boy all

145
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:42,389
generate steam this team will generate
pressure but a lot

146
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,960
a little bit of pressure and that
pressure will force the water

147
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,669
down and then up through that siphon

148
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:54,240
and that that makes up the coffee the
Coffee Co

149
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,340
and then I'll come up into the upper
reservoir

150
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,950
you see there's a lot how we're here
where that the water will come out of

151
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,000
and that will make the coffee one thing
that

152
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,519
was commonly used to see people doing in
Naples was

153
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,970
they were taken to a small mental power
most like a steaming pot for milk

154
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,690
and put all the sugar for the public
coffee in there and when the first few

155
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,769
drops a coffee came out

156
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,930
from the the top %uh the the mocha part
the pore tightening cream it

157
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,010
with sugar almost sure what you're
making a very

158
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,279
concentrate frosting or something I
would they would use a spoon cream that

159
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,250
sugar

160
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,420
and that the first few drops a coffee
together

161
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,630
and then when you pour the coffee into
that metal container after was brewed

162
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:44,209
I'm he would be almost like a Crammer
kinda of a crime on top

163
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:47,860
I'm I'm not sure what's different I've
tried doing that the last couple times

164
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,959
and couldn't go to work anymore

165
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:53,820
I'm I used to do this all the time
fifteen years ago but I'm so either the

166
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,010
sugars different or other copies differ
I'm different but

167
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,660
any case if you see people doing that
that's that the attempt is to come to a

168
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,100
pseudo crema

169
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,519
I and I will just let this go they will
check back in a couple minutes

170
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:10,070
okay receiving an action shot here the
coffee actually starting to brew

171
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,320
the water's been on the boil here for
about a minute should be getting pretty

172
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,329
close

173
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:17,519
and you'll see that the copy start to

174
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,050
first %uh kinda whose herbicide also
despite a little bit and then it should

175
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,209
come in a steady stream

176
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:26,810
and here we go the first drops are
coming out

177
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,050
and this for your cough a little bit is
what they call it works but some coffee

178
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,079
and the juice will pick up a steady
stream this is actually just

179
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:39,370
group keeping the cost up but you see
coming out into a trick or this will

180
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,670
speed up

181
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:45,769
as the the water begins to our come down
or get harder faster and pressure

182
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:47,139
increased rapidly in

183
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,899
nose strips or sputtering out and that
means is probably a good time consider

184
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:52,380
closing the lid

185
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,750
because I guess the very tail and when
there's more steam and water

186
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,940
this will turn to our sort of spotter or
below coffee out

187
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:05,149
and I'm wearing a white shirt so let's
close the lid

188
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:09,130
in this should be done hopefully in
about 45 seconds

189
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,610
okay I can hear that this is just about
done it's so I just sore sputtering

190
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,860
towards the end

191
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,000
so soon is it's finished you want to get
this off the heat

192
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,310
we don't want to to cook at upper
chamber any more than we need to

193
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,410
and died in all good warmer will have no
cup is already warming

194
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,610
and will allow take a look at server to
a standard

195
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,130
are stegner witness which was a lot of
apart milk

196
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,720
not just in italy has a calf LA but on
this would be another

197
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,839
with making a very for standard

198
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:45,120
a capital H A you do the the hot milk
separately

199
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,790
added to the very strong coffee with
usually plenty of sugar

200
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:53,230
into an even in preparation of Cuban
coffee or cup a coupon or

201
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,740
would-be as we have the same process
using something like a

202
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,089
como que express because you run or most
people don't have

203
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:04,699
three four thousand dollar expresso
machines in their home that's what book

204
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:06,120
that's how they get their coffee

205
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,579
so much time earned midday as a coffee
break

206
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:13,779
quick espresso at the cafe but at home
people are using things like a

207
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:18,250
the smoke express to me to make a are
relatively strong

208
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,190
a cup of coffee which is a through the
the practical way of making

209
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,899
espresso price for the milk swarm I know
I'm pouring this into a are

210
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:31,490
to a small class as opposed to a cop I'm

211
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,680
before when was a semi hate mail about
that are being a traditional corporate

212
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,730
yeah I know

213
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:39,899
I just wanted to show with the
consistency the coffee I don't have any

214
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:43,730
clear coffee mug coffee cup so I'll use
this little

215
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,940
them in our class and
