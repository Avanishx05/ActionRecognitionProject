11
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:11,879
to about the center are the pressure
valve now put the basket in place

12
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:15,559
to make sure you didn't put too much
water in the bottom kept the basket

13
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:19,720
if water comes up you have a little too
much the mocha pot is made to make an

14
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,979
exact amount coffee

15
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:24,180
you really need to put the right amount
of water in the pot

16
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,390
next we'll fill the filter basket with
fine ground

17
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,540
is six or seven grams the coffee per
ounce today for our coffee

18
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,649
worry is not pre sick of the original
Special Blend

19
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,090
us press 0 pre see this is a fantastic
espresso

20
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,600
that's surely small batch roasted what a
flavor profile

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,939
constructed specifically furthest I love
coffee making

22
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:48,450
so how do you know just how to find the
coffee needs to be ground

23
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,619
one simple way is to go to your nearest
grocery store

24
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:56,170
by a small amount a coffee beans maybe a
quarter pound and grind it in the stores

25
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,109
coffee grinder

26
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:00,159
just like this one grinding on the
espresso citing

27
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,640
and use this as your control sample so
you know what the coffee should look

28
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,030
like

29
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,630
when you grind it at home you want to
make sure there's no coffee

30
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,469
in the stores trying to be four you
prepare your sample loosely fill this

31
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:13,299
basket and don't pack it down

32
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:18,609
it's okay at the basket is just over
filled now issued a top piece on tightly

33
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:21,659
settle on the slow watch and listen

34
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,229
when you see this team in here the pot
lovely
