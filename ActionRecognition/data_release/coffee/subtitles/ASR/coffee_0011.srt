25
00:00:08,829 --> 00:00:11,970
you don't use any less because

26
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,250
it needs that quantity to perform for
probably

27
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,340
and if you do more than home

28
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,869
you know if you look hot over that and
now in it so can function properly if

29
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:23,130
you put too much pressure

30
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,399
thanks for the call littlefield this is
a little fun

31
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:34,369
I'm so custody and this is what you used
to produce for so you so your coffee

32
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:37,790
so I was going to take a program coffee

33
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:42,810
of course I'm just phase but for best
results you can grow into quantum

34
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,140
just if we wanna re sub-issues a

35
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,840
medium senator on his as phone

36
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,730
as you would use for an espresso machine
but you don't wanna

37
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,819
task force's much through for entry side

38
00:00:56,819 --> 00:01:00,440
somewhere in between usually wakes best
its bid for giving it doesn't have to be

39
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,230
precise

40
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,500
known to go ahead end zone just

41
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,260
evenly put in the coffee India is no
need to compress into

42
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,550
botanical you can have a compressed
needs to be released so that we can fly

43
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,110
three

44
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,190
in force from we feel a I can say

45
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,370
so they can say I've filled up the om

46
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,959
top funnel Bay WI the program coffee
it's all just Lucy just don't wanna

47
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:30,050
pack it in so same otherwise it's not
gonna let them wander through

48
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,239
speed next step

49
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,659
is I'm to you put this together

50
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,510
basically so you've got some with you
start to feel BAE

51
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,470
like a silicon ring that's done for many
seal heat for you

52
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,790
and a little fills the screen that's
gonna stop a motive

53
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,300
the grinds getting through into actual
drink so it's pretty

54
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,610
feels really

55
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:05,200
and then put the Iranian cynically to
get

56
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,440
in

57
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,640
easy screwing the two together

58
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,099
so you wanna do that

59
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,370
until it's just I not to talk to the was
you

60
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,010
Reckitt but just enough to formally meet
tight seal

61
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,879
my no one sits on

62
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,680
not something the next step step 3 I
guess

63
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,650
is just a puppet strings the medium I'm
heat on your plate and

64
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:48,060
stop the brewing process C-one techie he
not

65
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,240
to you get there the hangover the direct
source

66
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,570
heats up easy gas so on some ban on

67
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,919
you don't want obviously the hot he up
on this he looks

68
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:02,900
you can integrate into it you don't know
on if it's something like an electric

69
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,660
one here

70
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,320
just keep it off to the side so it's
nothing indirect a the same to the

71
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,310
design to stay relatively cool to touch

72
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,570
so the nipple was this is going to take
probably

73
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,870
you know about five minutes to happen
and

74
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,600
will come back when it starts to starts
to break so take a few minutes just to

75
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,530
explain what's happening in the process
of growing this coffee

76
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,960
so the naturist 02 warehouse design is
that you feel that the bottom reservoir

77
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,389
we cold filtered water arm

78
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:37,400
by pipeline heat sources what it's going
to do is is hate the template that water

79
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,180
of course creating steam which is going
to build up

80
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,090
fresh respond compartment the pressure
that builds up in there once it gets to

81
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,860
the right point

82
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,250
is going to stop forcing that he said
what up through the bottom of that fun

83
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,770
on and and go through the coffee grinds
which is going to be the extraction fue

84
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,990
coffee

85
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,530
grimes Victor brewed espresso is then
going to Kenya

86
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,160
the the top of this spare your

87
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,880
any into the sort holding with reservoir
the top

88
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,960
that's where the coffee ultimately spam
finishes its Bri

89
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,100
now one as a sign it's important not to
have that he too high

90
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,800
because what that will do he's in the
coffees for one thing

91
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,419
heat the water too quickly into hot on

92
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:29,620
you want to avoid that so that's why I
suggest a medium heat to stop if you

93
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,990
want to experiment for what's best for
you

94
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,470
you know some it might find in the day
you to Jorge Doral 08

95
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:41,280
any on this starts arms this is still
just heating up gently

96
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,000
and now I'm like a high in this press 0

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,080
or or proper spur sorry brewed under

98
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,180
extreme pressure is not going to be that

99
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,300
monthly fee golden crime at the Eagle
most shots

100
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,460
extractions what you'll find is this

101
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,630
is a small amount of grimacing on top I
suppose you can call it that

102
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,660
you'll see when when the bridge happens
what's going on name

103
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,970
found the basically don't get that
reached peak

104
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,120
honey like creme other you would offer
hi extra

105
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:21,139
high-pressure extraction because this is
the press release is not quite as much

106
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:24,630
some other things that I I want to use
the espresso for of course it's a lovely

107
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,509
smooth

108
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:28,990
way to bring you coffee and I'm teens to
get rid of a lot of

109
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,509
the on business or sickness

110
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:37,160
we can start here opening up in the
bottom

111
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,680
you it seems to balance at the flight is
really well not funded usually quite

112
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,380
dismayed

113
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,819
coffee on to drink

114
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:50,699
think this I really quite full point I
so they do sin up quite well to me know

115
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,220
on if you like to heat milk found and
use the espresso

116
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,479
in that city you make use of what some
things that's

117
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:01,520
inside good said butts

118
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,599
here we go as you can see coffee just

119
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:07,960
stuff to do before the top

120
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,349
is this is happening too quickly war I'm

121
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:17,129
its it's flowing really fast then you
know you've got the heat you find

122
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:20,340
smoking reduced sleuth what's this

123
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,009
brewing

124
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,400
online too soon as you see fit gauge
when when the

125
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,090
was about three-quarters two-thirds
three-quarters full I like to remove it

126
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,120
from the heat source

127
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,150
down because you don't want to run the
bottom

128
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:43,259
some you take it off the moved on

129
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:47,039
so basically it's running and it would
enhance put up through the funnel

130
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,289
& Young's extractions for you ok way so

131
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:53,629
you well it was unjustly that CK for

132
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:58,690
to finish Dublin 1 and we'll be back in
a few moments to use is the bridge

133
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,610
complete all set up just like I would
hear

134
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,719
I'm only if you have to work a long
black style that drink
