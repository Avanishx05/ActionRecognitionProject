10
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:21,020
on

11
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:29,070
studying classes start

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:44,200
or an account the the

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,680
the

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,590
the

15
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:02,640
the

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,130
the

17
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:14,900
ha

18
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:20,310
the the

19
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,850
the

20
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:33,110
the

21
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,369
beams

22
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:43,570
so

23
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:48,390
we do next and the mock

24
00:01:48,390 --> 00:02:05,940
Sol

25
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,080
ideally you wouldn't put I'll water more
than

26
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,220
up to all for and

27
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,650
last only to remain inside

28
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,620
is dead as an anchor know if you can say

29
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,400
just cool Lee

30
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,620
tell used opposing just 10 Mb

31
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:36,500
are clearly

32
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,090
a let people Dez as a measure

33
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,340
for the water and you routine back

34
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,470
person use it

35
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:52,620
saw got your field

36
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,910
make sure that stripe

37
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:12,800
and drop in the cockpit

38
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,160
so one thing you don't want to do he is

39
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,360
compressed zip if you

40
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,390
well Tom P

41
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,800
for example on good problem

42
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,240
with the I'll case

43
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,690
it's going to be beater the water

44
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,840
with tape longer to to call

45
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,600
and you will over to the coffee I'll

46
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,630
you don't want to call hurt the

47
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,940
did we miss while I

48
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:56,210
if it lasts is OK

49
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:00,560
but go over K

50
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,140
so

51
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:14,660
should

52
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,750
I and two-time this so that

53
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,020
later task re said

54
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,050
back on their all

55
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,350
sheesh

56
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,180
from long

57
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,750
me to my to candy

58
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,970
top close doesn't carries

59
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:47,090
peaceful on on the breakup so the cost
structure doesn't cool off

60
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,620
back to normal on walkable

61
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,630
missed that this phone just increase the
pressure

62
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,300
on usually Tomoka Paul

63
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,560
youporn the lawn and now

64
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,070
far pressure due to this team that is
generated

65
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,100
bottom arm this one because

66
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,220
too slow issue to our own

67
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,190
to showing off from iraq I'm not even
sure about it

68
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,640
and I'll when there is enough pressure

69
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,780
is a critic of the week push the

70
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,030
I'll and in with make

71
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,500
Kramar Park

three minutes

78
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,290
most fluent to say can use an extra fine
grind

79
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,960
for coffee I used to be

80
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,280
course not to cause just to be

81
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,910
course shows prospective my opinion

82
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,450
else read that the tell she not flowing

83
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:34,380
and when you see it you want to turn off

84
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:43,350

85
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:48,499
