31
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:09,930
right about there

32
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:15,549
you don't want to go over King

33
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:19,510
then the coffee holder

34
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,670
holds the coffee right above that

35
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,870
you notice it has lots of little holes a

36
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:30,060
so what happens on the water starts
boiling steam pressure Mexico up

37
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,049
through the coffee um

38
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:37,280
and and even though

39
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,630
this is the coffee around years I've got
some Fargo

40
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,440
in a container is once you open this
these are backing pack

41
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,769
bricks by the way and you can get these
almost anywhere these days I know

42
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:54,470
karema charges a and

43
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:59,440
person yeah here angler and it goes on
sale

44
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,750
tele that got some

45
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,190
this is not Maxwell House crash rose but

46
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:11,070
Inc to have I'll spoons for some sort of

47
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,109
here

48
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:18,120
coffee scoop works fine and

49
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,220
to fill this up

50
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:30,590
and it is also important to tamp it down
as it is with some other fancier

51
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,250
machines

52
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,959
some other the really a

53
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,540
fancy machines like to get a restaurant
often they're made in Italy and a

54
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,549
they rely on steam pressure but they are

55
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:46,590
pump driven and pump a

56
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,190
the education system steam pressure but
they also talked a lot

57
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,229
I am gonna tap it down

58
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:58,930
don't work my hands are clean

59
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,120
just wash now looks

60
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,530
then put the top lock is what happens
when the

61
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:17,169
steam pressure goes to the coffee
grounds it comes out here at the top

62
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:22,500
and I'll it comes down

63
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,199
and also after a little while you want
this

64
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:29,680
to be shot but for sure lasyone

65
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,520
certain to come out and that's I'll an
important part

66
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,220
parties who the top of here why leave it
open sea concealer for starts to come up

67
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,300
and I need to point out that this is the

68
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,759
the but the call three cup size you can
get these

69
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,370
a for anywhere from

70
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,590
six to ten dollars finally

71
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,650
pick while they come in different sizes
this is the nine cup size

72
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,210
a I found this while

73
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,800
at bloom for eight dollars

74
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,280
were deal a this one

75
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,159
alt mall and they may come out well I
think 15 cup size

76
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:15,930
make the smaller the three cups ice up
fast at the point out there

77
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,960
I have to face this because the handle

78
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,550
about to break off so I use a little
clamp

79
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,930
a gotta do what you gotta do it

80
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,460
out the best way it works now

81
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,870
important parts sugar such as the

82
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,939
three cup size per 3-14

83
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:42,580
ship obviously if you have a sweet tooth
you could put in more

84
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,469
or if you got like sure you could do it
with outer

85
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:49,810
old ok you

86
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,740

flame or stovetop this is a gas

90
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:14,439
a startup which is really much better
because it's easier control Richard L

91
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:17,729
you can use electric but missile

92
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:22,159
typical attack

93
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:26,749
it houses trial right

94
00:04:26,749 --> 00:04:31,169
K somehow got the flank

95
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:34,310
