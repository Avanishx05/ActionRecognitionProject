15
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,430
so missed

16
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,960
possible sprawling

17
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,430
up and I set my coffee grinder to

18
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,120
espresso total very fun

19
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:22,030
said

20
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:37,050
there

21
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,000
planned

22
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,329
nice

23
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:52,740
did not get it

24
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:59,220
all

25
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:10,400
K keep

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:29,940
all home

27
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:37,890
builders

28
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:45,040
people don't smoothed over

29
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,040
up

30
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,430
no

31
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,060
edge

32
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,900
so we can hope this can school in Taipei

33
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:07,920
cake

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,430
no

35
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:19,269
turn the printer on high but that
they're

36
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:22,640
it'll take a couple months more state

37
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,650
perking up the world

38
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,819
what happens in HR percolator its the
water

39
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,849
turns to steam down here and it's four
stop

40
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:35,980
through the filter and then part

41
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,290
through this little so under their

42
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:46,220
and off the top and fills up the top of
the the pot and it makes a very strong

43
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,420
up a copy so it is a lot like a spoiled

44
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:55,810
its

45
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:21,740
and going to stop it was come back

46
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:28,590
was not boiling yet but

47
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,310
yessi even it's a cream like Willis
presso

48
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,320
similar process is just the pressures
and quite as much as a

49
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:49,440
those with a real espresso machine

50
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,660
to close the schools when it starts to
boil steam comes over the top

51
00:03:53,660 --> 00:04:10,490
mister

52
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:16,230
oil

53
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,270
up

54
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:59,860
tape
