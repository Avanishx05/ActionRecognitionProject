37
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:15,660
we're going to do then

38
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,860
and you don't wanna go more than that
because

39
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,459
then when you put your

40
00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:24,730
proper grounding you wanna make sure

41
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,350
that the water didn't come up in this
area because you don't want to get your

42
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,360
coffee grounds

43
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,390
where before you actually make a call
game

44
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,500
so take this over here

45
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,040
you know here some coffee already agree
on a grounder here

46
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:53,170
finally going on

47
00:00:53,170 --> 00:01:01,240
espresso of okay

48
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,530
okay have a but coffee

49
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,150
into the basket you notice I've got a
pretty well

50
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,990
full but they caution you

51
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,080
not to pack because if you packed the
coughing

52
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,280
grounds in there you could cause

53
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,150
it to the stain not come through the way
it should

54
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,320
and you could build up pressure on that
there wouldn't be a good okay so now I'm

55
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,720
gonna

56
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,160
screw top own and set it on the stoked
on

57
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,700
and we'll see what it okay

58
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,230
we have the top skirt on

59
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,830
something neglected to mention all goes

60
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,430
mmm around the time of %uh the

61
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,660
coffee basket yet to make sure that it
stays good inkling

62
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,140
fringe group back together so that you
make good CEO between the bottom Tom

63
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,340
as rubber gasket in New that you want to
make sure the

64
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,350
it is clean

65
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:07,790
you don't want get coffee grounds in
there annual

66
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,660
do look here in

67
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,770
once we start

68
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,980
hearings this team color from the bottom
will actually start seeing coffee come

69
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:24,540
out okay im startin hear something going
on

70
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,260
been about three minutes and

71
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,760
I'm a few years now but you can actually
hear

72
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,490
staying making a racket in the bottle
pop down there

73
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,170
what we ought to be seen here just in a
min

74
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:48,080
is some good espresso coffee coming up
through that

75
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,990
will bring in the center there and when
it does we'll have closed the top down

76
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,600
because

77
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,570
after the coffee comes out it starts

78
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,490
long will this thing now middle spew out
here own

79
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,990
in kitchen will with week

80
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,610
there we go

81
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:14,610
air comes the espresso map

82
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,410
okay and

83
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,860
in just about another minute or two it's
gonna start

84
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,440
making a little bit churchill jervis I
know

85
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:39,080
and you know it's just about done

86
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,500
the good

87
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,110
it

88
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,560
I think it's about the United

89
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,740
in where you can tell it's finished

90
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,090
is when it stops making that noise

91
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,480
okay so it's GE first about that point

92
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,420
when all the water in the bottom has
been covered in just a minute stamens

93
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,320
come up through the

94
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:26,730
coffee grounds it would require

95
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:32,300
so loosely in RR the lady espresso maker

96
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,620
actually did Leslie working expressing

97
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:45,230
good me

98
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:51,050
you know it's kinda hard
