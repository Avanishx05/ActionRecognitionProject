7
00:00:01,189 --> 00:00:05,379
a coffee filter and I just put it over
the bottom hole the bottom

8
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:09,390
drain hole in here and I just keeps all
this loose soil from coming

9
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,820
out the bottom at first until it gets
nice and

10
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,290
a lil bit more compact in their kick it
is very very loose

11
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,820
and this I'm is a succulent and

12
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,000
cactus mix has a has a lot of perlite

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,190
it has arm a system crash rockin it

14
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,760
sometimes that as horticulture of and
because the succulents wanna be

15
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,220
really really really dry so it's
important to use our

16
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,930
I a cactus and succulent makes when
doing this so

17
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,030
what you're gonna do use your going to

18
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,470
Press aside the pot if it's really

19
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,890
I I know that this one is not critically
pop out if it's really pop and you can

20
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,260
you think he love your hand and you can
write press go around and then you can

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,500
Paul the plant out

22
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,620
me to be a little careful with that
because these paddles can

23
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:04,140
kick panels can break off there we go
there

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,590
there there the roots there so I need to
add a little bit more

25
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,110
into here cuz I like to leave it up a
little bit

26
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:17,090
about that the

27
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,220
edge up at their baby because it is is
it is gonna think down also to

28
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,500
this is gonna pop it's going to get a
lot of babies of here

29
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,850
and now I'm gonna use my favorite thing
to condition the soil which is

30
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,640
worm castings and compost I just work a
little better that in there because

31
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,220
succulents really don't need fertilizer
at all they're so tough and so strong

32
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,349
and then I'm just gonna go back in I'm
gonna fill around with

33
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:45,569
nice loose soil gonna work it

34
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:50,490
all around here press it down

35
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,800
a little bit fill it up a little bit
more because the soil is

36
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,540
solu- is going to it is gonna sink down
a bit so

37
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,730
so what I do is I I will keep this plant
dry

38
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,810
for about 337 days just so I can settle
in

39
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,940
and then I'll give it a really good
watering it it takes a while for their

40
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,480
this really loose mix to get wet

41
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,130
and then it's gonna think down a little
bit and then I will go through when I

42
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:16,980
will add

43
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,550
a little bit a more a bit on the top
