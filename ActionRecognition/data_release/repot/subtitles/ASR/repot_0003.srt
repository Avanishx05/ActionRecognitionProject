9
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,550
this slightly larger while two sizes
larger

10
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,910
than the existing parts and put away

11
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,290
horticultural Chris in the bank

12
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,550
Hall house for the drainage then

13
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,430
take a piece of paper a place that
over-the-top

14
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,000
a proper classical circle out put it
over the top the grapple

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,430
stop soil from falling through

16
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,489
being washed through the park when you
watch the plant priceline.com possum

17
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:35,090
just using

18
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,479
ordinary potting compost into the bottom
of the pot

19
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,710
just permit down slightly take the
plants

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,920
and tap it ass if it's pop this one's
really

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,369
really grown into the pot very least see
all the routes

22
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:56,100
filling the entire base the parts and
skin removed

23
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,710
just the top it's a comp costs you can
hear him actually breaking up

24
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,950
some other race beat quite gentle but

25
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:07,350
nonetheless take the top out top
centimeter

26
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,409
of this plan citing very wet as well

27
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,670
gently to you some other routes out from
the side plant

28
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,659
your fingers don't worry too much but it
be careful not to break the plan tonight

29
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:19,549
but don't worry too much about to

30
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:23,600
about damaging just listen up so that
the roots are encouraged to grow

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,350
towards the outside rather than just
friends around in circles

32
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,740
just make sure the pots going to sit
correctly

33
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,610
the plant could sit correctly in its new
part I'm going to fill

34
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,990
in round the size the plants with some
new compost

35
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,190
be quite gentle with this plant is quite
brittle

36
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,480
I don't want to break it off

37
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,980
want to make sure that it's it's in the
center the pots

38
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,629
I'm affirming the new soil down the
sides

39
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:59,459
plant make sure there's no air pockets

40
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:04,030
just cover the top of the so I'll
surface where you remove that top one

41
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,040
centimeter

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,770
a soil before

43
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,250
firm the soil in my lights put a little
bit

44
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,530
more Chris around the plants just
address the surface

45
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,650
expect that protect
