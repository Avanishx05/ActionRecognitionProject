40
00:00:00,209 --> 00:00:03,890
okay so I've chosen this this nice I
clay pot

41
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:08,620
gourmets glaze on its really pretty it's
kinda makes big drain hole in the bottom

42
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,939
you wanna make sure that has a nice big
drain hole so that the water had a

43
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:13,129
chance to run away

44
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:17,959
so it's not sitting in and moisture and
bring peace a paper towel on the bottom

45
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:20,079
you might choose do some stones or

46
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,969
a sponge or whatever you want for a I
have to keep some soil and

47
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:29,129
and a but absence or over this

48
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:35,709
first let's check this out take that
paper towel off she was nice enough to

49
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:38,200
put it in some damp paper towel which is
nice because

50
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,219
it's been sitting out for about a week I
am

51
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:46,489
she did this last Saturday

52
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:50,719
and I'm on Saturday again

53
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,069
you might see this I at a different time
but it's been about a week

54
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:59,290
sitting out and it still looks good I we
got some routes going on here this is

55
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,450
world problems attach the main plant

56
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,310
as you can see there's another one here
some healthy root systems going on

57
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,980
they'll get much better when they when
they reach the soho

58
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,439
just gonna take off some of these damage
leaves

59
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,400
fantastic

60
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,639
so I just wanna see where they'll fit in
here

61
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:27,409
I don't wanna plant them too deep I
wanna plan to maybe to this point right

62
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:27,870
here

63
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,590
I if I plan to Deepdale wrought

64
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,139
if I plan to shallow they won't do well
so I wanna maybe this 10 plan to this

65
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:36,920
level here

66
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,529
already could see that so I'm gonna add
a little bit more soil

67
00:01:41,529 --> 00:01:45,510
a surprise I haven't had an aloe vera

68
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,900
a plant in a very long time so those
things they

69
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,290
I a I say I need to get but I'd never do
get

70
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,450
and yeah

71
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:00,750
it's one of those things I always seem
to have all the crazy stuff but nothing

72
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,069
nothing really common

73
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:05,120
so anyway I

74
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,530
think we've got a deep enough here now
under plant these

75
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,220
sorta separate but kinda in the center
the pot

76
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,410
kinda criss-crossing each other

77
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,599
me move where's my

78
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,699
they have a

79
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:31,139
I have a bucket for my soil

80
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,020
I wanna add enough soil around here too

81
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,669
to support my I'm using a pre Morrison
soil

82
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:43,780
when dealing with cactus and succulents
it's not necessary to use a primo since

83
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,669
oil

84
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:48,660
I am sometimes it's better to not use a
pre voice is so because

85
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,900
you need a few days for the big powers
over

86
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,430
before you well water the ENP but this
has been sitting out for a week so

87
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,960
Primos and soil wasn't gonna do any
damage

88
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,759
the root system has already calloused
itself over things are

89
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,389
on their way to recovery I'm sure it's
already thinking new growth new growth

90
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:08,580
new growth

91
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,740
so we should be good smoothing the stuff
around where wanna

92
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,780
packing the soil in I firmly around

93
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,009
the base in the planet's you

94
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:29,690
adding a little bit more so here trying
not to make them too deep
