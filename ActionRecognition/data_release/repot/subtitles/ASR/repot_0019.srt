14
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,770
then next pottery shot now does this one
is slightly and gold

15
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,620
this goes over the holes

16
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,169
on what it does is it keeps the soil
then

17
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:10,629
allows the water

18
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:12,150
to drain out okay

19
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,180
first off

20
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,730
few hunt for the sole

21
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,409
so the next thing we did three remove
the plucked from the container

22
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:23,050
caffrey tanner upside down

23
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,770
grasped the trunk family and look at
that great

24
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,130
so i'll go look at all those routes

25
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,080
katya handle about them

26
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,360
and gently lower her into the container

27
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,480
centralize that

28
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,549
and then there's the soil regatta grade
so i'll have

29
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:44,460
itself

30
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,320
a little bit of native soil

31
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,020
add some organic mulch

32
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,049
that is primarily paid months

33
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,330
and coco fibre

34
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,360
make sure when you plug the pond

35
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,710
that the original thought a level

36
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,840
is not loaded for everything needs to
remain the same

37
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,010
so i really start lies there

38
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,740
parliamentarians and ideas about every
forty days

39
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:16,750
little bit and uh... little bit more
mulch

40
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,480
and hey presto it's is it is is that

41
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,860
the last thing confine our watering can

42
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,599
the last thing we need to do is to give
her a good watering and in the content
