23
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,390
planet

24
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,820
we've got her for we got a lot

25
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,380
love I lateral roots this is very
rubdown

26
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,520
we've excluded much of the soil that

27
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,270
that contains the nutrients so what we
need to do is prune away some of these

28
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:18,650
re

29
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,470
these older routes that gives us space
to develop some more Andrew hairs

30
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,689
are at the same time will replace some
love this older soil with some fresh

31
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:28,750
potting soil

32
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:33,780
so to begin we're just gonna take off
about ten to twenty percent

33
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,909
that actual root mass with some pruners

34
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:40,619
so I'm just gonna go in here and take
off summer this

35
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,640
bottom most root mass

36
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,540
now as I clip making sure that I don't
get

37
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,050
too close to the actual crown on the
planet if we do any damage up here

38
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,239
we're likely to lose the plan but
surprisingly

39
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,000
we can do quite a bit uprooting on these
routes from the bottom part

40
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,270
the plan is very resistant to this kind
of

41
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:07,340
a this kind of change so I'm gonna
remove

42
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,530
a large portion those those bottom roots

43
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,030
also gonna make some cuts up the side of
the pot

44
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:18,780
begin promotes those routes to take hold
in the new

45
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,959
in the new plant I'm new potting soil
medium

46
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:29,440
K

47
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,010
so now I'm gonna rip someone that apart
begin to give more space for

48
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,800
a for new development or development new
routes

49
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,080
I'm gonna look for any diseases any in

50
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,519
any insects that may have gotten into my
pots over the

51
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,760
over the few months that we take in a
day in and out of the house

52
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,650
okay and I'm gonna get a rhythm some
love this potting soil that's

53
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:58,390
from the past few years K

54
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,810
I'm gonna take a look inside a mild pot
and make sure that there's no insects

55
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,269
and here it is dirty

56
00:02:05,269 --> 00:02:09,560
com you you can feel free to wash these
and reuse them

57
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,860
I'm gonna reuse the same pot so arm

58
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,599
some wood increase the size in the pot

59
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:20,980
the problem with that is then it's a
larger plant I have to take in and out

60
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,549
out of my house every day okay so this
point I'm ready to

61
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:29,049
to repot this plant I'm gonna put some
fresh soil in the bottom of my pot

62
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:32,739
when a press it down a little bit so a

63
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:36,150
so I got follow the air pockets out

64
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,189
and I'm gonna place my plant back into

65
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:42,379
its original pot and fill in the sides

66
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:45,780
from

67
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:54,080
now over the next several weeks

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,720
all make sure to keep this planet I'm
well-watered

69
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,859
all IOU's 0 I A a water-soluble

70
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:04,459
liquid fertilizer like Merkel grow over
the next week

71
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:08,220
I'm are once a week for the next few
weeks
