22
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,270
so at the first thing you need to do
with take a pat on the hot and something

23
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,450
that can be pretty tricky to get up
rattle

24
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,860
hot are if it's an automatic nursery
container

25
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,720
you can give the pot Heath needed can
only thing it up

26
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,709
and then also that's not working
conflict hot upside down

27
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:25,500
support it with one hand and then being
uptight

28
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,170
that usually lets you

29
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,820
plan of so now

30
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,540
when you have roots that are really
rebound like this we need to loosen them

31
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,790
%uh and for their knowledge oil if you
just go ahead and put it on the next hot

32
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,170
armed of keep playing around cell what
you do is you just started

33
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,400
general begin to work come apart shake
out from there that

34
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,530
a lil in the middle and just listen up

35
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,070
30 ideally 14 all be

36
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,470
hanging down my family is

37
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:05,780
im because then when you put them into
the new hot

38
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,519
people spread them out and they won't be
growing

39
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,070
in that tight circle when you choose a
new hot there's a couple things you want

40
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,769
to look for

41
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:18,440
pursuer hot that only an inch or two in
diameter bigger

42
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,880
and the pot that day container that that
wasn't already

43
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,720
and the reason why is a few plant into a
huge pot

44
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,330
there's a lot that s the oil and when
you water there's so much to help

45
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,470
can take up all the water well for the
file

46
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,459
stay wet longer than it should and that
can cause real problems and

47
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:41,269
other things can go around your plans so
you want a Papa

48
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:45,220
the right height plans and so I'm a
little help with this

49
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,250
little plan to its new pot the first
thing

50
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,090
if the Jets add both the Wellington
about

51
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,040
the bottom third hot and then

52
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,940
take your plans and stick it in

53
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,370
flaring out the truth and see how deep
it is in the pot

54
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:09,310
many were the crown a rather rude come
out the planner

55
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,340
out to be about 10 inch below the
surface and that

56
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,450
give you plenty of faith to water when
you're walking

57
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,230
without having the water delivered at so
just double check that

58
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,989
and then you can go ahead and Selim from
soil

59
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:29,140
just around added a pair and gently tap
into place you know what impact the file

60
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,380
but he also won a tank at Red any air
pockets that are down there

61
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,519
so get the soil in nice estimated

62
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:40,390
kinda with it out and then to really
handle the file

63
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,319
a key if to water at and that are really
getting your facts better

64
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,810
out and are here

65
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,170
of settled into its new pots ok
