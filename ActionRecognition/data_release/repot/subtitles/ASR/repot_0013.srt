15
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:05,800
pretty easy because I just I just got
back from the grower like a month ago

16
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,310
so you even out the pot

17
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,960
their North you might have to cut the
pot of if it's really if it's really pop

18
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,479
found so don't be afraid of that

19
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:22,409
and certain loosen it up you can see the
roots right here group oh boy

20
00:00:22,409 --> 00:00:26,260
too sure loosened up has the what I've
done is I put enough

21
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,530
so I O in the pot so that loops

22
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,760
his mother fell off some input from
where the soil in here to to raise it up

23
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,210
a gear

24
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,030
because I wanted up about happen inch
above the pocket is gonna sink down

25
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,280
cell little bit more here so I'll

26
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:49,750
