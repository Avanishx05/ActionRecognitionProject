30
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,710
every pound they are actually that's not

31
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,960
too bad

32
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,960
sure you can see it the Sun is the the
Dexter

33
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,240
so it it's a little bit said Amanda
roots but it's not

34
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,830
not horrible so I really took out the
first

35
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,860
said i've star leaves up a bit and will
plant this

36
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,660
probably a little bit further down

37
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,450
so this'll actually grew roots anything
that you put under

38
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:38,310
under the dirt will grow more reads
something at just a little bit %uh soil

39
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,780
here

40
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,500
my party mix the bottom and I'm gonna
add

41
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,070
gonna do bout twenty spin

42
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,700
the beach fertilizer Saudi they are
gonna blinkers that

43
00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:00,700
it in the bottom an eye out a little bit
more

44
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,010
so mix it up a little bit

45
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,420
and we're gonna break up these routes
just a little bit

46
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:16,690
right

47
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,980
but that spun down as we can

48
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,430
so while I hold the stem with one hand

49
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,610
nanopores the the soil and not the other

50
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,459
just to keep it straight and centered

51
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:35,050
anywhere pack it down a little bit and
ivory cream ice and dust

52
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,130
potting mix which is Merkel grew

53
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:44,360
forget party mix that was that at Costco
from $9.99 for 55 QuickPay

54
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,620
so it's a really good deal have already
gone through

55
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:54,739
how the three bags if it already so that

56
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,970
is our heartaches
