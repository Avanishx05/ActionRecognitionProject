13
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,230
from the container

14
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,710
look at that great route system

15
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,539
keeping your hand on the bottom of the
plan

16
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:19,059
placing her really journalist rule

17
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:23,899
you can hear a squeal alright why she
settled nicely in the container

18
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:29,170
important to have I remember that in the
bottom of all the containers as a whole

19
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:34,340
and so put a few a broken pottery shards
or a few stones over that and it'll stop

20
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,049
the soil running out onto your patio
deck so with nice ridge

21
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:42,610
organic soil fill up the sides

22
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,090
to the original soil level of the plug

23
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,560
really important to remember

24
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,090
as you fill the container up with the
soil don't forget to use some slow

25
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,630
release fertilizer and a

26
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:01,500
which he will do about every the 30-40
days this will keep the plug really well

27
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:01,990
fed
