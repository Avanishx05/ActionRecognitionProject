12
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:05,660
is take chartres place it over the hole
in the bottom of the pot

13
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,579
making sure that you don't completely
block up the whole water still needs to

14
00:00:09,579 --> 00:00:11,590
be able to get out of it are you plant
will drown

15
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,110
next to take a look at how big the pot

16
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,530
is that the plant is currently in and
how big the pot

17
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,579
is that you're gonna put it in you want
to make sure that the plant is going to

18
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:23,309
be sitting

19
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:27,909
in about at about the same height in the
soil so you need probably to put some

20
00:00:27,909 --> 00:00:29,119
soil on the bottom the whole

21
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:40,090
first had some soil

22
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,960
that looks like a bad enough soil the
next step is to take the plant at the

23
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,290
pot it's currently in

24
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,620
this is a plastic pot so it's going to
be pretty easy to do

25
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,020
if it were a terra cotta pot it's a
little harder you have to really

26
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,030
use some elbow grease and sometimes if
it's been in there a long time

27
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,380
even have to break the pop with this
plastic pot

28
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,650
with simple given a couple good bumps

29
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,820
to loosen the park net

30
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,300
help her plant pots

31
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,500
you wanna loosen the soil on the bottom

32
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,110
check turned the plant around make sure
there aren't any roots

33
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,300
better going all the way around the pot
if there are you need to tease them out

34
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,040
or sometimes even just cut them it won't
hurt the plant at all

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,729
they'll just grow some new routes now
it's time to pop it in its popping in

36
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:34,540
and that look like about the right
height

37
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,120
when you're putting a plant in a pot you
don't wanna put it

38
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,350
right up to the top level the pot or
when you try to water it

39
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,730
the water with this run right out I'm
gonna

40
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:51,950
back bill with our potting soil making
sure that push it down in loosely don't

41
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,530
want to pack it in cuz that'll

42
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,840
get all the air out of the soil but you
do want to make sure there aren't any

43
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,250
big

44
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:03,480
giant holes down in there the plant

45
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,299
shake tap settle it in there

46
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:10,870
not the last step

47
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:17,390
is to give the plan to drink water you
want to make sure that you water it

48
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,500
thoroughly until water is coming out of
the holes in the bottom up the pot

49
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,650
it's much better to water fewer times
thoroughly
