30
00:00:00,999 --> 00:00:05,100
what we're doing first is putting some
rocks in the bottom sets gonna let the

31
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,389
water at the bottom conjuring up more
easily and

32
00:00:07,389 --> 00:00:10,829
again it won't drown the route to the
plan and

33
00:00:10,829 --> 00:00:14,810
we put this synthetic fabric over those
rocks

34
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,630
and then a little bit and this organic
potting soil that you see the left

35
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,659
we're gonna put that in next entry and
nice

36
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:25,340
level foundation so here we are just

37
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,919
porn this in an ominous knew that a
little bit with my hands in

38
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:35,970
and make it an make it level so the next
important step

39
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,010
is taking the plan at its all

40
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,530
putting usually you can you know don't
water it because otherwise it'll be

41
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,810
let let it dry out a little bit you can
see that the roots there

42
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,000
they're all bunched up through pound
investment definitely need to be

43
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,720
repotted

44
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,500
to turn the pot sideways grab it by the
top firmly as you see there

45
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,319
and just pull the pot out or pull the
plan to the park should use landau

46
00:00:58,319 --> 00:01:02,269
so here it is and you can see how much
smaller the old

47
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:06,500
the volume of the old part was versus
the new one now when I'm doing is I'm

48
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,159
using my fingers to break up the routine
can separate them out so that they can

49
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,409
they wanna be tied up in knots its can
help the plan adapt

50
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,450
and and get nutrients and water in its
new

51
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,790
pa home they're gone just

52
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,459
stringing out getting all the dirty in
and setting it right in the middle

53
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:28,879
and not too high and leaving a man inch
between the top and the

54
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,099
swell here and the RAM love this new pot

55
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:35,689
and and my friend here she's gone around
the edge
