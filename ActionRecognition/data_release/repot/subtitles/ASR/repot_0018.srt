7
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,180
by carefully pulling in bikers out of
the pot

8
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,739
is really rebound this might be a little
bit of a challenge

9
00:00:08,739 --> 00:00:13,399
feel free to squeeze pretty hard once it
slides out a bit spot

10
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:16,820
check to see if the plant is rebound

11
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,030
if it was rebound in 10 massage the
roots

12
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:29,260
spread them out so they're not growing
in a tight circle once you

13
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,410
massage your roots place your plant in
that spot

14
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:36,030
and then start to fill it in with high
quality potting mix

15
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,239
now this is important use high quality
potting mix you don't want to use garden

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:40,799
soil

17
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,729
garden soil can cause the plan to rot
and also introduced pests diseases like

18
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:47,140
insects in the home

19
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:53,430
you don't want that one other helpful
tip is that as you feeling your partner

20
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,920
so I'll

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,350
make sure the implants at the same level
it was going in before

22
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,500
you don't want to plant it too deep

23
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:06,340
otherwise you can also called running
issues Avenue you fill your partner so

24
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:06,740

plans a really good drinking water
