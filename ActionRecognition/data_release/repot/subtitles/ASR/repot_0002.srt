22
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,810
you know I parts I broke in the drop on
the floor you could take a stone

23
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,040
and you just wanna put that in the
bottom what that will do is it will stop

24
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,659
the soil from running out as you water
it but it is not going to stop

25
00:00:15,659 --> 00:00:19,280
the water from running out this part
about an inch higher than the old one so

26
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,369
if I were to put this

27
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:24,220
in the bottom what's going to happen is
it's going to be too deep

28
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,900
you want the plant sitting at the same
level

29
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,310
that it was in your previous pop so how
we gonna do that what we're gonna put

30
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,100
some soil

31
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,530
in the bottom and we're gonna raise the
soil level up

32
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,000
so that when I place this plant in the
pot it will be just as high

33
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,439
a general all-purpose oil is pretty good

34
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,600
for a plant like this prayer plant that
we're using when it estimate about how

35
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,590
high up

36
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:53,009
I want that's and where things you want
to do if you really wanna pack that

37
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:53,600
doubt

38
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,720
one step before I finally put the seine
I wanna

39
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,179
keys the route we want to encourage some
growth so now

40
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:04,010
we put this n I've got a little bit of a
room there at the top of the

41
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,749
plant so that when I do water it's not
going to run out the sides are

42
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:09,389
over-the-top you have your soil

43
00:01:09,389 --> 00:01:13,609
and what you gonna do if your gonna pack
this in and it's very important

44
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:16,989
you pocket in very tightly

45
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:21,069
he have like a little who like this a
small spade

46
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:25,620
you could use that to help get the soil
down in there
