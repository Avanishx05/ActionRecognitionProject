20
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,109
and then you're able to turn it upside
down

21
00:00:05,109 --> 00:00:10,600
so I'll pull it out a bit spot and i
wanna break up the root ball just a

22
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,280
little bit

23
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,470
so that it can this it can work the
roots can work their way into the new

24
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,130
soil

25
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:30,729
and then

26
00:00:30,729 --> 00:00:35,229
go ahead and put it into a new part up a
little bit of soil

27
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:39,400
down to the bottom to start out you want
to keep the

28
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,439
plant the base of the plant at the same
level it was a reason the original soil

29
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:47,470
if you bear your plant too deep down in

30
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,130
it actually can cause

31
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,079
the plant to rock more easily trying to
get it

32
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,030
position where I want and then

33
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:20,770
had soil around

34
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,209
and then you can use that ok piece of
wooden dowel rod to press the soil down

35
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:25,670
in

36
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:38,250
had just a little bit more soil

37
00:01:38,250 --> 00:02:03,280
and then I like to top dress

38
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,000
my soil with a granite gravel it really
is just an aesthetic choice

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,159
and

40
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:25,270
to split up around the top of the soil

41
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:33,050
and you can use the large tweezers the
precedent around the base of the plant
