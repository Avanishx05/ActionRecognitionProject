6
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,350
paper plant is a course to have a good
container

7
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,380
and a some good soil normal you're gonna
wanna step it up into a

8
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,730
container this at least one size larger
then what something came from

9
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,679
with pepper plant you might start off
with something small like this and then

10
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,520
go directly into maybe a gallon

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,890
five-gallon or maybe into something like
a North park's

12
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,270
make sure you've got a good soil and a
good container

13
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,800
now for repotting your little plant
we're going to take the plant we're

14
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,390
going to

15
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,719
remove it from its beginning container
we're a little

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,140
the root system and gently pull at root
system apart if is rebounding almost

17
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,270
every little container plant is

18
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,410
and the next stage after we polls all
routes apart

19
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,440
we're gonna put it into the container
and planted about the same dept level it

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,299
was before

21
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:52,689
and maybe add a little bit of dirt
around it and then kinda packet in with

22
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:53,479
her fingers

23
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:56,520
just like pressure

24
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,950
and the next step

25
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:04,549
is going to be watering corporal water
in here and make sure there's no air

26
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:05,890
pockets in the container

27
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,340
and it gives our little botanical body
and nice during
