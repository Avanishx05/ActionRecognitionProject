21
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:02,890
going to do is fill

22
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,090
the pot about one third of the way with
the potting mix

23
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:12,149
now

24
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:22,480
I'm going to remove my plan from its all
pop

25
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,370
I wanna separate the roots that they're
able to

26
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,580
settle in and spread out into the new
larger pot

27
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:42,590
you can also use a guard and I for this

28
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,400
the place the clintons the new pot and
then continue filling with more potting

29
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:47,920
mix

30
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:58,970
up to about one inch below the rim of
the pot after you finish filling your

31
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,130
pot with the potting mix

32
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,430
you wanna lightly pack it down and now
it's time to water

33
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,630
you wanna water newly re potted plant
pretty thoroughly slits able to settle

34
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,650
into the new pot
