40
00:00:00,209 --> 00:00:03,890
okay so I've chosen this nice
clay pot.

41
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:08,620
It's got a nice glaze on it. It's really pretty. it's
got a nice big big drain hole in the bottom.

42
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,939
you wanna make sure that it has a nice big
drain hole so that the water has a

43
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:13,129
chance to run away.

44
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:17,959
so it's not sitting in moisture. I'm putting a
piece of paper towel on the bottom.

45
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:20,079
you might choose to use some stones or

46
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,969
a sponge or whatever you want 
to keep some soil in. 

47
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:29,129
Let's add some soil to this.

48
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:35,709
first let's check this out. take the
paper towel off. she was nice enough to

49
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:38,200
put it in some damp paper towel which is
nice because

50
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,219
it's been sitting out for about a week.

51
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:46,489
she did this last Saturday

52
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:50,719
and I'm on Saturday again.

53
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,069
you might see this at a different time
but it's been about a week

54
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:59,290
sitting out. it still looks good. Its
got some roots going on here this is

55
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,450
where it was probably attached to the main plant.

56
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,310
as you can see there's another one here.
some healthy root systems going on.

57
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,980
they'll get much better when
they reach the soil.

58
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,439
just gonna take off some of these damage
leaves.

59
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,400
fantastic.

60
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,639
so I just wanna see where they'll fit in
here.

61
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:27,409
I don't wanna plant them too deep. I
wanna plan to maybe to this point right

62
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:27,870
here.

63
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,590
if I plant them too Deep they will rot.

64
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,139
if I plan them too shallow they won't do well.
so maybe this one I'll plant to this

65
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:36,920
level here.

66
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,529
Alright hope you could see that. so I'm gonna add
a little bit more soil.

67
00:01:41,529 --> 00:01:45,510
I am surprise I haven't had an aloe vera

68
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,900
plant in a very long time. It's one of those
things they

69
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,290
say I need to get but I never do
get.

70
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,450


71
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:00,750
it's one of those things. I always seem
to have all the crazy stuff but nothing

72
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,069
really common.

73
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:05,120
so anyway I

74
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,530
think we've got deep enough here now.
I'm gonna plant these

75
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,220
sort of separate but kinda in the center
of the pot.

76
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,410
kinda criss-crossing each other.

77
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,599


78
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,699


79
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:31,139
I have a bucket for my soil.

80
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,020
I wanna add enough soil in around here

81
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,669
to support them. I'm using a pre moistened
soil.

82
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:43,780
when dealing with cactus and succulents
it's not necessary to use a premoistened

83
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,669
soil.

84
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:48,660
sometimes it's better to not use a
premoistened soil because

85
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,900
you need a few days for them to callous over

86
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,430
before you water them in. but this
has been sitting out for a week so

87
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,960
premoistened soil isn't gonna do any
damage.

88
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,759
the root system has already calloused
itself over. things are

89
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,389
on their way to recovery. I'm sure it's
already thinking new growth new growth

90
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:08,580
new growth.

91
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,740
so we should be good. smoothing the stuff
around to where I want it.

92
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,780
packing the soil in firmly around

93
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,009
the base of the plants.

94
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:29,690
adding a little bit more soil here. trying
not to make them too deep.
