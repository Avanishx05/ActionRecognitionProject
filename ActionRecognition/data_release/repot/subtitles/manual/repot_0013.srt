15
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,800
This one is probable gonna come out pretty easily because I just got
it from the grower like a month ago.

16
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,310
so you ease it out of the pot.

17
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,960
you might have to cut the
pot off if it's really potbound.

18
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,479
so don't be afraid of that.

19
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:22,409
you sort of loosen it up. you can see the
roots right here.

20
00:00:22,409 --> 00:00:26,260
It's sure loosened up. 

21
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,530


22
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,760
Looks like some of it fell off. so i am gonna put some more
of this soil in here to raise it up.

23
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,210


24
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,030
because I want it up about half an inch
above the pot because it is gonna sink down.

25
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,280
so. a little bit more here.

26
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:49,750


27
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,080
there we go. that's gonna get it. you
can just hold it together if it starts to

28
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,090
fall apart you can

29
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,229
hold that together up here. I love
worm castings and compost.

30
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:03,540
it's what I meant by plantings
wiz. so I'm gonna go in and put a few

31
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,750
handfuls of that

32
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:10,080
around here before I go ahead and fill
it in.

33
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,110
then I'm gonna in

34
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,149
and fill around so the

35
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:20,310
plant will be supported in the pot. I'm just
gonna go around. I'm gonna fill in

36
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,750
with

37
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,140
soil all of the way around said so
it's nice and even up here.
