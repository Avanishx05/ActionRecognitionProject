10
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,360
place the coffee filter in the pot making
sure that you cover

11
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,440
any drainage holes that are in the pot.
then put a thin layer of soil

12
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,710
in the new home. now the amount of soil that
you put

13
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,770
in the pot will depend on the size of
the pot that you're using.

14
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:23,030
you never want to increase the size by more
than two times the original size of the

15
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,890
container that

16
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,090
gerbera daisy is in. once you have that
layer of soil in

17
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,570
you will need to remove your gerbera daisy
from its

18
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,760
old home. to do this you can simply
cut away the plastic pot.

19
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,200
if you don't want to do that gently tip
down your

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,930
gerbera daisy upside down and simply tap
on the bottom

21
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,000
and squeeze on the sides. the next step
is to tease the roots. teasing those

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,110
roots are giving them permission and
telling them they can grow out

23
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,350
well and your root ball to fill up its
new home in no time.

24
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,820
then put your gerbera daisy in the
container. fill in with soil

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,110
making sure that you don't overfill with
soil.

26
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,750
you want the soil level that the plant
was in originally

27
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,689
to be the exact same soil level in the
new pot. once you have done that gently

28
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:12,689
tap on it and then water.
