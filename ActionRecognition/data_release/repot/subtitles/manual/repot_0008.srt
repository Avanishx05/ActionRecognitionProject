53
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,780
I usually have my trash bucket and my

54
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,690
good soil bucket. being very gentle, pull the pot out.

55
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,600
move the old pot out of the way.

56
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,810
and kind of crumble 

57
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,520
the roots.

58
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,100
taking care not to damage the roots

59
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,250
but try to get as much soil out. 

60
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:42,300
for the most part it's gonna rip all
so i think im just gonna leave it alone.

61
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,910
make sure to even it out there at the bottom a
little bit.

62
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:53,600
take your new pot and here's the
trick.

63
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,630
when you put him in make

64
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:02,810
sure that you get it all in the rungs

65
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,730
being very careful. having two people do
this is better than one.

66
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:13,290
make sure that it goes in. now it didn't go in
all the way.

67
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,000
okay so what we're going to have to do is to
have to take it back out.

68
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,520
being very careful. you can take
it out just a little bit.

69
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,630
since I already have some mix in there
 I can take some of it out.

70
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,330
being very careful not to break the
branches.

71
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:40,210
like so.

72
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:51,290
I didn't say it was going to be easy.

73
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,860


74
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,500
so then we will try it again. put it in
there.

75
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,070
okay. perfect.

76
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,580


77
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,910

78
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,919


79
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,229


80
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:22,870
put your soil in there.

81
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:28,380
see this wire shelf idea is really good
because you can just sit there and shake

82
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,780
all the dirt in here. throw it in there.

83
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,760


84
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,780
and then pat it.

85
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,130
now don't worry about the branches falling
out right now.

86
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,270
you don't really need to be concerned
about that.

87
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,770
but your main concern is getting that soil dow in

88
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,090
the root area.

89
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,130
okay. That's good.
