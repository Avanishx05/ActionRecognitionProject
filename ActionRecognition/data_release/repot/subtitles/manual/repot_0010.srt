22
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:08,900
Loosen your compost so it's nice and airy. each container

23
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:15,600
should be three-quarters full and match
the size of your plant.

24
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,480
remove plant from the pot and loosen
the old soil

25
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,910
away from the roots. the aloe plant

26
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,490
has very shallow roots so don't be
alarmed at it's very small size.

27
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,310
tease away

28
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,729
any small daughter plants from the main
one. again don't worry

29
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:44,400
about the amount of roots on each small plant.
make a hole in your compost

30
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,959
and firm the plant in place. once the
plant is in place

31
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:54,070
top off with more compost and firm ion again.

32
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,770
the small plants

33
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,940
can be planted together in a large
shallow pot.

34
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,100
Aloe plants prefer space to spread
out sideways rather than going down in the pot.
