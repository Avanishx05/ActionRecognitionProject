20
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,109
Use an old tee shirt or towel to cover the top of the plant and then you're able to turn it upside down.

21
00:00:05,109 --> 00:00:10,600
so I'll pull it out of it's pot. i
wanna break up the root ball just a

22
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,280
little bit

23
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,470
the roots can work their way into the new

24
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,130
soil.

25
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:30,729
then

26
00:00:30,729 --> 00:00:35,229
go ahead and put it into a new pot. I'll put a
little bit of soil

27
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:39,400
at the bottom to start out. you want
to keep the

28
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,439
the base of the plant at the same
level it was in the original soil.

29
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:47,470
if you bury your plant too deep down in

30
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,130
it actually can cause

31
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,079
the plant to rot more easily. trying to
get it

32
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,030
into the position I want and then

33
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:20,770
add soil around.

34
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,209
then you can use the piece of
wooden rod to press the soil down

35
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:25,670
in.

36
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:38,250
add just a little bit more soil.

37
00:01:38,250 --> 00:02:03,280
then I like to top dress

38
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,000
my soil with granite gravel. it really
is just an aesthetic choice.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,159


40
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:25,270
just put it up around the top of the soil.

41
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:33,050
you can use the large tweezers 
to press it in around the base of the plant.
