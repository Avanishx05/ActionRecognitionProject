7
00:00:00,189 --> 00:00:05,379
I've taken a piece of a coffee filter and I just put it over
the bottom 

8
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:09,390
drain hole in here and it just keeps all
this loose soil from coming

9
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,820
out the bottom at first until it gets
nice and

10
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,290
a lil bit more compact in there. till then it
is very very loose.

11
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,820
this is a succulent and

12
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,000
a cactus mix. it has a lot of perlite

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,190
it has some crushed rock in it.

14
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,760
sometimes it has horticultural sand
because the succulents wanna be

15
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,220
really really really dry so it's
important to use

16
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,930
a cactus and succulent mix when
doing this. so

17
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,030
what you're gonna do is you are going to

18
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,470
Press the sides of the pot if it's really rootbound.

19
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,890
I know that this one is not partuicularly
pot bound. if it's really pot bound you can

20
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,260
use the heel of your hand and you can
really press and go around and then you can

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,500
pull the plant out.

22
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,620
you have to be a little careful with that
because these paddles can

23
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:04,140
break off. there we go.
there.

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,590
there are the roots there. so I need to
add a little bit more

25
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,110
into here cuz I like to leave it up. a
little bit

26
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:17,090
above the

27
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,220
edge of the pot there. 
it is gonna sink down and also

28
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,500
this is gonna pop. it's going to get a
lot of babies off of here.

29
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,850
now I'm gonna use my favorite thing
to condition the soil which is

30
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,640
worm castings and compost. I just work a
little bit of that in there because

31
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,220
succulents really don't need fertilizer
at all. they're so tough and so strong.

32
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,349
then I'm just gonna go back in and I'm
gonna fill around with

33
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:45,569
this nice loose soil. gonna work it

34
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:50,490
all around here. press it down

35
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,800
a little bit. fill it up a little bit
more because the soil is

36
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,540
so loose it is going to sink down
a bit.

37
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,730
so what I do is I will keep this plant
dry

38
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,810
for about 3 to 7 days just so it can settle
in.

39
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,940
and then I'll give it a really good
watering. it takes a while for

40
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,480
this really loose mix to get wet

41
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,130
and then it's gonna sink down a little
bit. then I will go through and I

42
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:16,980
will add

43
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,550
a little bit more of this on the top.
