22
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,270
so the first thing you need to do
is take your plant out of the pot and sometimes

23
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,450
that can be pretty tricky to get the plant

24
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,860
out of the pot. if it's in a plastic nursery
container

25
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,720
you can give the pot a few squeezes to loosen it up.

26
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,709
if that's not working
you can flip the pot upside down

27
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:25,500
support it with one hand and then bang it on the side.

28
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,170
that usually lets you

29
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,820
pull it off.

30
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,540
when you have roots that are really
rootbound like this we need to loosen them

31
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,790
up so they are not all coiled. if you
just go ahead and plant it in the next pot

32
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,170
they will keep coiling around. so what
you do is you just start to

33
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,400
gently begin to work them apart. shake
out that soil from the middle

34
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,530
and just loosen up those roots.

35
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,070
ideally you want them all to be

36
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,470
hanging down nice and loose.

37
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:05,780
because then when you put them into
the new pot

38
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,519
you can spread them out and they won't be
growing

39
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,070
in that tight circle. when you choose a
new pot there's a couple things you want

40
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,769
to look for.

41
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:18,440
first you want a pot that is only an inch or two in
diameter bigger

42
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,880
than the container that
the plant was in already.

43
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,720
the reason why is if you put a plant into a
huge pot

44
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,330
there's a lot of excess soil and when
you water there's so much soil that the plant

45
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,470
can't take up all the water that's in the soil. 
so the soil 

46
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,459
stays wet longer than it should and that
can cause root rot problems and

47
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:41,269
other things can go wrong with your plant. so
you want a Pot

48
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:45,220
that is the right size for the plant. so I'm 
gonna go ahead and put this

49
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,250
little plant into its new pot. the first
thing

50
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,090
is you just add some soil up till about 

51
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,040
the bottom third of the pot. then

52
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,940
you take your plant and stick it in

53
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,370
flaring out the roots and see how deep
it is in the pot.

54
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:09,310
you want the crown of the plant where the roots come out of the plant

55
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,340
to be about an inch below the
surface and that

56
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,450
give you plenty of space to water when
you're watering.

57
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,230
so just double check that

58
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,989
and then you can go ahead and fill i with 
soil

59
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:29,140
just around the edge of the plant. gently tap
it into place. you don't want to pack the soil

60
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,380
but you also want to try and get rid of any air
pockets that are down there.

61
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,519
so get the soil in nice and smooth.

62
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:40,390
kinda smooth it out. then to really
settle the soil

63
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,319
the key is to water it. That will really
get any air pockets that are there out

64
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,810
and get your plant all

65
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,170
settled into its new pot.
