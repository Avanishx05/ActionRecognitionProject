22
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,110
you don't realise that the moss is actually killing the plant because it retains so much moisture

23
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:10,079
that the plant can't breathe. so what
you want to do first

24
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:13,240
is go ahead and remove all of this moss.

25
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,000
you don't want all of this moss. you want to clean it all out.
you want to be kind of careful of the roots. The

26
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,259
roots are usually on the 

27
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:23,540
outer side. the middle part is where the moss is.
there are some

28
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,340
roots that kinda hide inside
but usually it's always on the

29
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,710
outer part because orchid likes to breathe.
it like to have a lot of air.

30
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,460
but the Moss compacts it. because of shipping
purposes

31
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,909
the moss is used so that it can retain a lot of
the water and moisture

32
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:43,909
for the plant. but in time it actually
drowns

33
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:49,590
the orchid if it doesn't get enough air to
dry out that moisture that it has retained.

34
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,090
and that is why the orchids always die. so you wanna remove

35
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,170


36
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,230
all of this mossy material here.

37
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,560
after you remove all of this moss it's pretty

38
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,459
basically simple. look at these roots.
this is

39
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:11,680
still in a very good condition to rescue.

40
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,140
a lot of times the roots have been rotted all the way and it's
really

41
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,000
kinda too late to rescue them.

42
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,980
now that we have it all opened up most of

43
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,569
the moss has been cleaned out you want to go ahead

44
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:34,500
and put some of that bark

45
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,420
into that pot. Probably like halfway or so. And you want to go ahead
and gently place the

46
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:46,090
orchid and wrapping those roots around the place giving it a 

47
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:52,590
sturdy kind of sitting inside the pot.

48
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,500
then go ahead and start adding more of that bark all inside

49
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,690
compacting the plant inside the pot. Basically this keeps the stability so the plant doesn't move around. 

50
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,540
It likes to be stable, not wobbly.

51
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,180
yet at the same time give it that air to

52
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:20,629
aereate. the roots like a lot of circulating air and stability.

53
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:24,980
you can see that the bark is bigger

54
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,750
so that the air can 

55
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,629
go insude and all of these wonderful

56
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:36,450
medium. tricko is actually

57
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,799
to rpevent fungus from growing and it's very nice to have as part of the medium.

58
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:47,189
Pearlite kind of opens up that medium. Kind of gives it that air flow inside the pot.

59
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:52,769
you want to use a clay pot

60
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:59,610
because the plant can actually breathe in clay rather than plastic.

61
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,850
Plastic actually suffocates. And now the secret to

62
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:08,389
keep your orchids happy and healthy. Don't use regular water.

63
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:11,580
because tap water

64
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,870
is filled with calcium, a lot
of toxins and chemicals. it is not really

65
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,110
good for the plant.

66
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,970
you want to use distilled water. this
is very pure. It is like

67
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,120
rainforest water. you kind of want 
to drench it with distilled water.

68
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,040
you can go to the market and buy it on sale.
usually it's like seventy nine

69
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,870
cents per gallon. a gallon lasts a long
time because you are gonna realise that orchids don't really need that much water.

70
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,080
it just likes to keep moist. It doesn't like to be

71
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,580
soaked in water. but because this is a new medium

72
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,759
the bark will retain a lot of the water at first.

73
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,470
so you want drench it.
