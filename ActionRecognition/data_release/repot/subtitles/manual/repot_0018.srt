7
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,180
Start by carefully pulling your plant out of
the pot.

8
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,739
if it is really rootbound this might be a little
bit of a challenge.

9
00:00:08,739 --> 00:00:13,399
feel free to squeeze pretty hard. once it
slides out of its pot.

10
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:16,820
check to see if the plant is rootbound.

11
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,030
if it was rebound you want to massage the
roots

12
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:29,260
and spread them out so they're not growing
in a tight circle. once you

13
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,410
massage your roots place your plant in
its pot

14
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:36,030
and then start to fill it in with high
quality potting mix.

15
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,239
now this is important. use high quality
potting mix. you don't want to use garden

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:40,799
soil.

17
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,729
garden soil can cause the plant to rot
and can also introduced pests diseases like

18
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:47,140
insects in your home.

19
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:53,430
you don't want that. one other helpful
tip is that as you are filling your pot

20
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,920
with soil

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,350
make sure the plant is at the same level
it was going in before.

22
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,500
you don't want to plant it too deep.

23
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:06,340
otherwise you can also cause rotting
issues. after you fill your pot with soil and

24
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:06,740


25
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,270
pack it in really well give your
plans a really good drink of water.

26
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,150
once your pot is filled in, water well.
