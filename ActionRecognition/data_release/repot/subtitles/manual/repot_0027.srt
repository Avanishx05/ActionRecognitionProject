46
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,000
this came out fairly easily but if it does
not and its

47
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,700
stuck in there, simply turning it
upside down

48
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,470
and tapping it either on the pot or on
the table will

49
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,530
release the pot and then you can go from
there.

50
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,360
the next step would be to carefully
break up that root system.

51
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,900
it's a good thing for the plant because it's
going to force it to send out new growth.

52
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,670
if we don't break up the roots they wont
branch out into the surrounding soil.

53
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:32,240
our next step is going to be to select a potting soil. there are a number that are

54
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,470
out there on the market.

55
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,560
it's a good idea to use a pre-packaged

56
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,060
soil mix that you buy from the store
rather than using garden soil

57
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,360
because garden soil is very heavy it stays
very wet

58
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,060
and can often at times contain pathogens
that can cause disease problems on your

59
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:47,640
plants.

60
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,770
you want it set at the same level
that it was originally.

61
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,480
also keeping in mind that you want about
a half an inch to an inch

62
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,890
of space between the top of the container
and the top of the the soil ball.

63
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,420
I'm gonna fill in with the rest my soil

64
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,910
and if the soil is very light very
fluffy

65
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:11,190
you wanna make sure that you pat it
down as it goes in that container.

66
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,280
you do not want to leave the top of the
soil ball exposed where there are roots

67
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,230
because what will happen is those roots
will kinda act like air wicks

68
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,370
and draw moisture out from the soils. the
final step would be to

69
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:26,130
water the plants thoroughly so that that soil mix gets saturated.
