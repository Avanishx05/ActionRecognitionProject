9
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:06,550
select a pot that is slightly larger. one or two sizes
larger

10
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,910
than the existing pot and put a layer of

11
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,290
horticultural grit in the bottom.

12
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,550
this helps with the drainage. then

13
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,430
take a piece of paper and place that
over-the-top

14
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,000
of the gravel. cut a circle out and put it
over the top of the gravel.

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,430
this stops the soil from falling through

16
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,489
from being washed through the pot when you
water the plant. place some compost

17
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:35,090


18
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,479
into the bottom of the pot.

19
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,710
just firm it down slightly. take the
plant

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,920
and tap it out of it's pot. this one's

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,369
really grown into the pot. It's very loose. you can see
all the roots

22
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:56,100
filling the entire base of the pot. I'm just gonna remove

23
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,710
the top bits of the compost. you can
hear them actually breaking up

24
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,950
some of the roots. be quite gentle but

25
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:07,350
nonetheless take the top
centimeter

26
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,409
of this plant out. It's actually very wet as well.

27
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,670
gently tease some of the roots out from
the side of the plant

28
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,659
with your fingers. don't worry too much about it but
be careful not to break the plant too much.

29
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:19,549
but don't worry too much about

30
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:23,600
damaging the plant. just loosen it up so that
the roots are encouraged to grow

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,350
towards the outside rather than just
branch around in circles.

32
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,740
just make sure that the plant is going to sit
correctly

33
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,610
in its new pot. I'm going to fill

34
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,990
in round the sides of the plants with some
new compost.

35
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,190
be quite gentle with this plant. It is quite
brittle.

36
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,480
I don't want to break it off.

37
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,980
I want to make sure that it's in the
center of the pot.

38
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,629
I'm firming the new soil down the
sides

39
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:59,459
of the plant. make sure there's no air pockets.

40
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:04,030
just cover the top of the soil
surface where you removed that top one

41
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,040
centimeter

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,770
of the soil before.

43
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,250
firm the soil a bit. I like to put a little
bit

44
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,530
more grit around the plants just
to dress the surface.

45
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,650
Makes it look a bit pretty.
