23
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,390
wiht this plant

24
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,820
we've got a lot

25
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,380
of lateral roots. this is very
ruootbound.

26
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,520
we've excluded much of the soil that

27
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,270
contains the nutrients. so what we
need to do is prune away some of these

28
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:18,650


29
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,470
older roots that gives us space
to develop some more root hairs.

30
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,689
at the same time we'll replace some
of this old soil with some fresh

31
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:28,750
potting soil.

32
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:33,780
so to begin we're just gonna take off
about ten to twenty percent

33
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,909
of that actual root mass with some pruners.

34
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:40,619
so I'm just gonna go in here and take
off some of this

35
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,640
bottom most root mass.

36
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,540
now as I clip making sure that I don't
get

37
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,050
too close to the actual crown of the
planet. if we do any damage up here

38
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,239
we're likely to lose the plant. but
surprisingly

39
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,000
we can do quite a bit of pruning on these
roots. from the bottom part

40
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,270
the plant is very resistant to this kind
of

41
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:07,340
change. so I'm gonna remove

42
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,530
a large portion of those bottom roots.

43
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,030
I am also gonna make some cuts up the side of
the pot.

44
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:18,780
it promotes those roots to take hold
in the new

45
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,959
potting soil medium.

46
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:29,440


47
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,010
so now I'm gonna rip some of that apart.
begin to give more space for

48
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,800
new development or development of new
roots.

49
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,080
I'm gonna look for any diseases any

50
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,519
insects that may have gotten into my
pots over the

51
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,760
few months that we have taken it in and
out of the house.

52
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,650
okay and I'm gonna get rid of some
of this potting soil that's

53
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:58,390
from the past few years.

54
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,810
I'm gonna take a look inside my old pot
and make sure that there's no insects

55
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,269
in here. it is dirty.

56
00:02:05,269 --> 00:02:09,560
you you can feel free to wash these
and reuse them.

57
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,860
I'm gonna reuse the same pot.

58
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,599
some would increase the size of the pot.

59
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:20,980
the problem with that is then it's a
larger plant I have to take in and out

60
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,549
of my house every day. okay so at this
point I'm ready to

61
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:29,049
to repot this plant. I'm gonna put some
fresh soil in the bottom of my pot.

62
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:32,739
I'm gonna press it down a little bit

63
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:36,150
so I have got all of the air pockets out.

64
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,189
I'm gonna place my plant back into

65
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:42,379
its original pot and fill in the sides.

66
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:45,780


67
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:54,080
now over the next several weeks

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,720
I'll make sure to keep this plant
well-watered.

69
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,859
I'll make use of a water-soluble

70
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:04,459
liquid fertilizer like Miracle grow over
the next week.

71
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:08,220
or once a week for the next few
weeks.
