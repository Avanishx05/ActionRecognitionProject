13
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,230
so we have chosen a really nice terra cota container. That's probably about twice the size of the ruble. we carefully remove the plant from the container.

14
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,710
look at that great root system.

15
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,539
keeping your hand on the bottom of the
plant

16
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:19,059
placing her really gently.

17
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:23,899
you can hear her squeal. alright. once she is
settled nicely in the container

18
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:29,170
important to remember that in the
bottom of all the containers there is a hole.

19
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:34,340
so put a few broken pottery shards
or a few stones over that and it'll stop

20
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,049
the soil running out onto your patio
deck. so with nice rich

21
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:42,610
organic soil fill up the sides

22
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,090
to the original soil level of the plant.

23
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,560
really important to remember.

24
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,090
as you fill the container up with the
soil don't forget to use some slow

25
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,630
release fertilizer in there

26
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:01,500
which you will do about every 30-40
days. this will keep the plant really well

27
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:01,990
fed and ensure you get lots of blooms and fresh new growth.
