30
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,710
We'll see how rootbound they are. actually that's not

31
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,960
too bad.

32
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,960
sure if you can see it. this one is the duster.

33
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,240
it's got a good amount of
roots but it's not

34
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,830
horrible. so I already took out the
first

35
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,860
set of starter leaves off of it and we'll
plant this

36
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,660
probably a little bit further down.

37
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,450
so this'll actually grow roots. anything
that you put under

38
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:38,310
the dirt will grow more roots.
so I am going to add just a little bit of soil

39
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,780
here

40
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,500
to my potting mix into the bottom. I'm gonna
add

41
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,070
about one teaspoon

42
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,700
of bleach fertilizer. so i will do the organo bloom first.
Take a teaspoon of that. Put

43
00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:00,700
it in the bottom. I will add a little bit
more

44
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,010
soyo. mix it up a little bit.

45
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,420
we're gonna break up these roots
just a little bit.

46
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:16,690
Alright.

47
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,980
Then we'll put that as far down as we can.

48
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,430
so while I hold the stem with one hand

49
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,610
I'm gonna pour the soil in with the other

50
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,459
just to keep it straight and centered.

51
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:35,050
you want to pack it down a little bit.
I've already pre moistened this

52
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,130
potting mix which is miracle grow

53
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:44,360
organic potting mix that was at Costco
from $9.99 for 55 court bag.

54
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,620
so it's a really good deal. I have already
gone through

55
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:54,739
probably three bags of it already. so that

56
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,970
is all it takes.
