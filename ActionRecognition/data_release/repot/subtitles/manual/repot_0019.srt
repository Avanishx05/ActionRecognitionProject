14
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,770
then next a pottery shard. notice this one is slightly angled.

15
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,620
this goes over the holes.

16
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,169
what it does is it keeps the soil
in

17
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:10,629
but it allows the water

18
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:12,150
to drain out.

19
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,180
first off

20
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,730
few handfuls of soil.

21
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,409
so the next thing we do is we remove
the plant from the container.

22
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:23,050
carefully turn it upside down.

23
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,770
grasp the trunk firmly and look at
that great

24
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,130
soil ball. look at all those roots.

25
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,080
keep your hand on the bottom

26
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,360
and gently lower her into the container.

27
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,480
centralize that.

28
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,549
in goes the soil. we've got a great
soil here.

29
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:44,460
it's

30
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,320
a little bit of native soil

31
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,020
it's some organic mulch

32
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,049
for this primarily pea moss

33
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,330
and coco fibre.

34
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,360
make sure when you plug the plant

35
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,710
that the original soil level

36
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,840
is not lower or deeper. everything needs to
remain the same.

37
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,010
slow release fertilizer.

38
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,740
I do this about every forty days.

39
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:16,750
little bit more mulch.

40
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,480
and hey presto it's as easy as that.

41
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,860
the last thing. I couldn't find my watering can.

42
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,599
the last thing we need to do is to give
her a good watering.
