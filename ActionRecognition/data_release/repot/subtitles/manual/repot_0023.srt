7
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,840
it's important to use new soil when repotting.

8
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,210
Although a new plant comes in a
container not only are these

9
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,460
fearly unattractive but the plant will
quickly outgrow it.

10
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,480
so you want to choose a different container.
of course you can buy containers in every

11
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,780
size

12
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:22,649
shape and color. think outside the box too. get
creative and recycle. if someone

13
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:23,880
is amazing at bowling

14
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,480
use a bowling ball bag. in all instances

15
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,370
you will have to drill or
cut a hole in the bottom of the container

16
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,610
to allow for proper drainage. some people
mix their own potting soil.

17
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,809
you can find recipes online or
simply pick up

18
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:44,259
potting soil at a garden centre. you want to provide

19
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:50,030
optimum drainage so the plant will thrive. people have used  all
types of materials for drainage

20
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,500
such as rocks broken pottery pieces and
even packing peanuts.

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,950
however now there's better than rocks.

22
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,170
its a 100 percent recycled plastic
mesh that is placed at the bottom

23
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:07,340
of the container. it improves drainage, prevents the
drain hole from getting clogged

24
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,660
and it helps oxygen reach the roots which is
necessary for the plant to absorb

25
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,780
nutrients.

26
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,880
therefore you will grow healthier plants.
better than rocks it is

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,929
also practically weightless making your
containers much lighter.

28
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:22,490


29
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,039
after providing adequate drainage add
potting soil.

30
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:30,890
add small amounts in the bottom. add a
little water.

31
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,980
then place the plant in the center and place more soil
around the sides

32
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:41,090
of the plant. press the soil down and add more
soil as needed until there is about an inch left

33
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:41,910


34
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,970
between the soil and the top of the
container. water thoroughly.
