Step 1. Before transplanting a plant into a new pot, even out its shape

5
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:10,180
by trimming away any excess growth around
the top of the plant. Transfer your plants

6
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:18,290
outside, or lay down a tarp or sheet so that
you can easily clean up excess soil. Step

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:23,630
2. Sterilize the new container by using rubbing
alcohol to avoid the spread of any disease.

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:29,170
Once it's dry, fill about one-third of it
with potting soil. It isn't always necessary

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:33,579
to buy new containers. Old containers may
fit a different plant. Just be sure to sterilize

10
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:39,689
them first. Step 3. While holding the plant
at the base of the stem with one hand, use

11
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:44,150
your other hand to tip the old container upside
down. Make sure to support the soil surrounding

12
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:48,750
the plant as you tip it upside down. Tap the
bottom and sides of the container to release

13
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,420
the plant from it. Once the plant slides out
of the container, turn it upright. Tapping

14
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,470
a stick around the edges of the pot can help
to loosen the soil and give the plant some

15
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:03,360
breathing room. Step 4. With the plant still
in your hand, gently pull away the old soil

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:11,909
until only the roots and plant are left in
your hand. Step 5. Now place the plant in

17
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,860
the new container, filling and packing soil
around it until the soil is even and about

18
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:29,509
a half inch from the top of the pot. Step
6. Give the plant a good watering. You're
