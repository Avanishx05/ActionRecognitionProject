10
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:06,620
so to do this prepare a clean dry pot
that is no more than two sizes larger than

11
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,640
the old one.

12
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,670
place a piece of broken clay pot or wire
mesh

13
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:14,019
over the drainage hole. now this prevents
the soil from running out when you're

14
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:16,800
watering but it still allows the water
to escape.

15
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,809
then add a layer potting mix to the
Bottom.

16
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:24,390
now to remove the plant from its current
container you want to place the plant stem

17
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,969
between your fingers like

18
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:29,730
this just to support the plant and then
turn the pot

19
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,080
upside down. now gently

20
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,550
tap the pot on the bottom. if it still sticks you
can

21
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,250
tap it in other areas around the sides as well.

22
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,350
then gently just remove the pot.

23
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,090
remove any dead or damaged roots

24
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,870
and then gently break up the roots from
the side

25
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,860
and the bottom of the root system.
then finally

26
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,700
remove any loose old soil from the top
to a depth of about a half inch.

27
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,000
place the plant into the new pot and add
more soil.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,080
now gently tap the soil with your
fingers but don't pack it too tightly.

29
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,380
fill the pot with soil until it's about
half an inch to an inch from the rim

30
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,150
of the new container. then water the
repotted plants thoroughly and you're done.
