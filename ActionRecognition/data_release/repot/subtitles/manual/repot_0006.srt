30
00:00:00,999 --> 00:00:05,100
what we're doing first is putting some
rocks in the bottom so that's gonna let the

31
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,389
water at the bottom drain out more
easily and

32
00:00:07,389 --> 00:00:10,829
again it won't drown the roots of the
plant. 

33
00:00:10,829 --> 00:00:14,810
we put this synthetic fabric over those
rocks

34
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,630
and then a little bit of this organic
potting soil that you see on the left.

35
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,659
we're gonna put that in next and create a
nice

36
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:25,340
level foundation. so here we are just

37
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,919
pouring this in. I'm gonna smooth this out a
little bit with my hands

38
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:35,970
and make it level. so the next
important step

39
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,010
is taking the plant out of it's old pot.

40
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,530
don't water it because otherwise it'll be wet.

41
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,810
let it dry out a little bit. you can
see that the roots there

42
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,000
they're all bunched up they are root bound
and this plant definitely needs to be

43
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,720
repotted.

44
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,500
so turn the pot sideways. grab it by the
top firmly as you see there

45
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,319
and just pull the plant out of the pot. it should just slide out.

46
00:00:58,319 --> 00:01:02,269
so here it is and you can see how much
smaller 

47
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:06,500
the volume of the old pot was versus
the new one. now what I'm doing is I'm

48
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,159
using my fingers to break up the roots and
separate them out so that

49
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,409
they won't all be tied up in knots. it's gonna
help the plan adapt

50
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,450
and get nutrients and water in its
new

51
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,790
pot home. there we go. I am just

52
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,459
stringing them out getting a little bit dirty.
then i am setting it right in the middle

53
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:28,879
and not too high. I am leaving about an inch
between the top of the

54
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,099
soil here and the rin of this new pot.

55
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:35,689
my friend here is just going around
the edge puttin potting soil along the sides.
