17
00:00:00,219 --> 00:00:04,479
when adding in the soil

18
00:00:04,479 --> 00:00:09,490
just keep in mind that youare gonna be putting a
somewhat mature plant in there. so give enough

19
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,300
space to grow.

20
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,869
and enough space to grow upwards. so don't fill
this too high or too low.

21
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:16,729
we are going to be moving this one

22
00:00:16,729 --> 00:00:19,800
to a separate pot today. as you can see it is quite mature.

23
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,460
it has somewhat of a

24
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,590
woody kind of feel on the outside. the roots on this one are 

25
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,830
maybe 20 centimeters down. so what you do is you grab a

26
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:38,450
shovel and just cut into it.

27
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:50,920
once the roots come out, it'll be easier to pull out.

28
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,159
nope.

29
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,170
it's not coming out. Dig it again.

30
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,420
what you can do is twist it.

31
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,400
once your pot is ready all you do is dig out a hole for your

32
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,500
plant. just make sure it's not too deep

33
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,920
because you do actually want the roots to grow downwards to get
more structure

34
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,950
and support.

35
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,990
okay.

36
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,560
put it in there and just bury it.
