2
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,200
1. Always make sure the scene is safe for
you and the victim.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,050
2. Check for response by tapping the victim's
shoulder and shout, "Are you okay?"

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,809
3. If there is no response, that is, if the
victim is unresponsive and not breathing,

5
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:15,829
or only gasping, then activate emergency system
and get or call for AED.

6
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:20,540
4. Check for the carotid pulse for at least
5 seconds but no more than 10 seconds.

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:25,620
5. If you do not feel the pulse, then start
CPR immediately, starting with chest compressions.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,900
Remember, start compressions within 10 seconds
of recognition of cardiac arrest. Push hard

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:37,420
and fast, at a rate of at least 100 compressions
per minute. Count out loud "1, 2, 3, 4, 5"

10
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,800
up to 30 compressions.
6. After 30 compressions, open the airway

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,260
using the head tilt/chin lift method. Give
two breaths. Deliver air over one second to

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,559
make the victim's chest rise.
7. Give one breath every 5 to 6 seconds for

13
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,640
a rate of 10-12 breaths per minute.
8. Continue 30 compressions followed by 2

14
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,590
ventilations, that is a ratio of 30:2, until
an advanced airway, endotracheal tube, combitube,

15
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,970
or laryngeal mask airway is placed.
9. Once the advanced airway is placed, then

16
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:12,150
start continuous chest compressions with ventilations,
at a rate of one breath every 6-8 seconds,

17
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,560
or a rate of 8-10 ventilations per minute.
10. AED should be used as soon as it is available.

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,890
Resume chest compressions immediately after
the shock is given.

19
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:28,189
Remember, for adult CPR the ratio of compression
to ventilation is 30:2 for both one and two

20
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:34,280
rescuers. For two rescuers, change the compressor
every two minutes or every 5 cycles to avoid

21
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,660
fatigue. Rescuers should try to change the
compressor role in less than 5 seconds.
