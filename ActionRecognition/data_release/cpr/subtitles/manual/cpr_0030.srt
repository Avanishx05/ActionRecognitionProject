10
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,390
so check to make sure there's no danger
on the palce. it could be electrical wire

11
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,579
could be some glass some fuel. anything
that you consider dangerous.

12
00:00:10,579 --> 00:00:14,809
that's the first thing to remove. next
we move on to

13
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:18,179
A for response. so talk and touch. can you hear me.

14
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:24,280
there's no response. okay
now we know there's no response. we move

15
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:24,519
on

16
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:27,989
to S for Send for help. so you have
someone here say

17
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:30,899
can you please go to call the ambulance
let them know we have an unconscious

18
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:31,409
patient.

19
00:00:31,409 --> 00:00:34,769
if you're the only one here and have a
phone pick up the phone

20
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:38,140
call triple-0 and let them know what's
happening so someone's on their way

21
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,490
while you're working on the patient. okay
now we move on

22
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,890
to A. A is for airway. so we have to check
if the airway is clean. first we need a little bit of head

23
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,020
tilt like this.

24
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,079
that allows some air to get in. secondly
we open up

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,420
have a look to make sure his airway is clean.
in this case it is.

26
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,890
there's nothing obstructing the air

27
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:00,370
getting in or out. okay now we have checked his
airway so we move on to B for breathing.

28
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,420
so I have to check his breathing. so open
up.

29
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,490
firstly what i do to have a listen and a
feel and i watch the chest.

30
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,680
nothing's going up and down I can't feel
anything coming out of his mouth I can't

31
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,580
hear anything either.

32
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,990
so he's not breathing. now that we know
he's not breathing

33
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,380
we assume he's going to need CPR. so we
move straight into center of the chest.

34
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,050
heel of the hand at the Center of the chest and
compressing

35
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,759
from here. now with CPR

36
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,220
we need to do a ratio of 30 compressions to
two Breaths.

37
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,710
and the rate of those 30 compressions
that one hundred per minute.

38
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,490
so that's not quite two per second. 

39
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,990


40
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:47,820


41
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:58,480
we immediately give two breaths. Jaw
support and head tilt again.

42
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,880
straight back to our 30 compressions again.

43
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:08,110


44
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,800
back for our two breaths. now with our CPR

45
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,640
and our 30 compressions and two breaths we
continue those until we get a response

46
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,420
until normal breathing resumes or till you are exhausted or until 
professional help arrives.
