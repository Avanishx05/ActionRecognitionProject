00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,940
open the airway. take the hand that's

of the other hand and put it on the bony
part of their chin. tilt back.

00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,319
next check for breathing. look

54
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:33,549
listen and feel for the breath. look for
the chest rising and falling.

55
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:37,370
listen for the breath in your ear and
feel the breath on your cheek.

56
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,769
do that for about five seconds.

57
00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:47,180
if there is no breathing you must give to
full breaths right away.

58
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,540
take two fingers of the hand that's on
the victim's forehead

00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:04,510
you are trying to breathe.

62
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,049
then check the circulation or check
the pulse.

00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:11,180
take two fingers and put it on the
center of the victim's throat

64

do this for about five seconds and if
there is no pulse

66
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,440
chest compressions must be started right

67
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,759
first position your hands
on the victim's chest.

68
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,340
take two fingers of the hand that's
closest to the victims feet

69
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,680
and slide it up the bottom of the rib
cage till you reach the notch

so that your shoulders are directly over
your hands.

75
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,660
while in this position enough pressure
will be created to compress the chest

76
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,729
one-and-a-half to two inches for an
adult.

77
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:03,900
do this fifteen times counting out loud.

78

79
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:10,650
continue the cycles of

80
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:15,050
breathing and compressions four times.
after the fourth time

81
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,180
check the victims pulse again. if
there is still no pulse

82
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,259
continue these cycles until the victim
breathes again
