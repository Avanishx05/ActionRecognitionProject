17
00:00:01,946 --> 00:00:04,666
Check for responsiveness
by shaking and shouting

18
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:07,246
at the person or rubbing
their chest bone hard

19
00:00:07,246 --> 00:00:07,946
with your knuckles.

20
00:00:08,436 --> 00:00:10,416
The person's clothing
is not removed.

21
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:14,116
Next, command someone to
call 911(or country's emergency number)
-- "Call 911."

22
00:00:14,116 --> 00:00:15,836
-- or make the call yourself.

23
00:00:15,836 --> 00:00:17,486
Then begin chest compressions.

24
00:00:17,786 --> 00:00:19,406
>> You aim for the
Center of the chest,

25
00:00:19,406 --> 00:00:20,986
usually between the nipples.

26
00:00:21,376 --> 00:00:23,176
Put the heel of one hand there.

27
00:00:23,476 --> 00:00:26,716
You put the heel of the
other hand on top of there.

28
00:00:27,036 --> 00:00:29,536
And you lock your elbows.

29
00:00:29,536 --> 00:00:34,276
And the reason for that is
that no one is strong enough

30
00:00:34,606 --> 00:00:36,926
to do 100 compressions a minute.

31
00:00:37,316 --> 00:00:41,386
And then you put your shoulders
directly over the center

32
00:00:41,386 --> 00:00:46,496
of the chest and you fall,
compressing it about 2 inches.

33
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:49,086
>> It's important that the
hands are lifted from the chest

34
00:00:49,376 --> 00:00:50,516
after each compression.

35
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:53,586
>> That's because the
recoil of the chest --

36
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:56,086
that causes a little
vacuum in the chest --

37
00:00:56,786 --> 00:00:59,866
causes air to go in
and blood to come back.

38
00:01:00,196 --> 00:01:03,326
It's also important to pump
on the chest fast at a rate

39
00:01:03,326 --> 00:01:04,686
of 100 times per minute.

40
00:01:05,296 --> 00:01:08,796
An easy way to maintain that
beat is to think of a disco song

41
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:10,966
like "Stayin' Alive"
by the Bee Gees.

42
00:01:11,526 --> 00:01:14,666
>> It turns out if you try
to do 100 times a minute,

43
00:01:15,086 --> 00:01:17,966
even if you're not perfect,
you have the best chance

44
00:01:17,966 --> 00:01:19,736
of getting the most flow.

45
00:01:19,856 --> 00:01:25,046
>> It is a jab-jab-jab-jab
rapid pumping action to move

46
00:01:25,046 --> 00:01:26,996
that blood forward to the brain.
