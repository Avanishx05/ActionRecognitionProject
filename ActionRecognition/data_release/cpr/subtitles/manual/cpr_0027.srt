28
00:00:01,119 --> 00:00:06,279
if this was grandpa Joe, we would go like grandpa joe grandpa joe. he doesn't respond so we need to move on

29
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:10,780
to the next step. the next step is
calling 911.

30
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,230
when you call 911 you need to make sure
that you give them as much information

31
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,280
as possible

32
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,560
so they are able to help you. you also
should never

33
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,790
hang up on the operator first because if you do
they

34
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,599
might not have all information that
they need to come to the

35
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:31,340
rescue. also if there are other people
around you should have them call 911 and

36
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,380
tell them what to do

37
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,780
so you are able to move on to the next
step more efficiently

38
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,230
and quicker. the next three steps

39
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,600
have an acronym known as CAB or cab. the
first

40
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,930
letter for that is C and you do
compressions.

41
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,180
to do compressions you put your hand out

42
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,470
so you see your palm and then you
wrap it around your fingers.

43
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,620
you locate the lower breast bone on the person

44
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,850
and put your hands there. you need to
do

45
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,800
30 compressions at a rate of 100
compressions per minute.

46
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,880
the Depth of the compressions should be at
least two inches.

47
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,530
so if this were grandpa joe this is what
happen. you should also count aloud

48
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:15,910
when you do it so

49
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,240
you know what number you are at. 

50
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,000


51
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,150


52
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:34,660
after you are completed with the compressions

53
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,760
you do the next part of cab which is

54
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,410
airway. to check the airway you should
put your cheek against his mouth.

55
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,410
when you do this you feel for moisture on your
cheek

56
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,690
listen for noises of breathing from
his nose and mouth

57
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:53,160
and look for chest rises. so
if this was grandpa Joe

58
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,190
we would go like this. look for Chest rises, feel for moisture

59
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,660
and listen for noise. next step

60
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,290
after that is to breathe into grandpa joe.

61
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,740
to do this you need to make sure that

62
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,460
the Airway is not obstructed and you need to put your
finger underneath his chin

63
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,670
so it's not clogged or anything. you
should give

64
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,739
the patient two breaths and these breaths
should be at a normal rate

65
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,610
at what you are breathing about right now.
make sure you plug his nose also so air does not

66
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,139
escape through his nasal passage.

67
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:34,830
so is this was grandpa joe it would go like.

68
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,080
after having completed

69
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,350
with the breath part you go back
to compressions. you repeat compressions breath

70
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,410
compressions breath

71
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,650
until the medical providers arrive.
