18
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:04,038
So in a situation like this, we see that the person is here.

19
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:07,096
We don't have our gloves on, but keep in mind that we're going to,

20
00:00:07,096 --> 00:00:09,097
in the practice session that we're going to follow this up with.

21
00:00:09,097 --> 00:00:11,033
We'll have our gloves on,

22
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:14,000
we need to make sure we have our personal protective equipment,

23
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,013
the scene is safe, and now we're ready to rescue.

24
00:00:17,013 --> 00:00:20,020
We call out to the patient - they do not respond.

25
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,072
We tap and shout on the collar bone.

26
00:00:22,072 --> 00:00:24,075
Are you okay? There is no response.

27
00:00:24,075 --> 00:00:27,082
At that same time, we are now looking for

28
00:00:27,082 --> 00:00:31,033
normal breathing, or abnormal breathing, no breathing.

29
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:36,017
Abnormal breathing, again, meaning agonal gasp for breath.

30
00:00:36,017 --> 00:00:39,097
This is not respirations. This is a drive to breathe

31
00:00:39,097 --> 00:00:44,020
that's not getting oxygen circulating into the bloodstream.

32
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:48,002
This person is unresponsive, not moving, not breathing.

33
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:51,054
We're going to activate emergency medical services or call a code

34
00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:57,002
and then we're going to check for a carotid pulse for no more than 10 seconds.

35
00:00:57,002 --> 00:01:00,057
This patient does not have a pulse, is not moving, not breathing.

36
00:01:00,057 --> 00:01:06,012
I'm going to find the center of the chest and start my 2-inch plus compressions.

37
00:01:06,012 --> 00:01:08,031
We're going to do this 30 times.

38
00:01:08,031 --> 00:01:12,095
The rescuing partner is going to then do the head-tilt chin-lift.

39
00:01:12,095 --> 00:01:15,065
Really get that head back far.

40
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:18,084
Cover the mouth and nose with their one-way valve mask.

41
00:01:18,084 --> 00:01:22,053
And they're going to give two full ventilations.

42
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:25,093
About a one-second breath each.

43
00:01:25,093 --> 00:01:29,025
We're going to check for chest rise and chest fall.

44
00:01:29,025 --> 00:01:31,040
Chest rise and chest fall.

45
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,064
If it doesn't rise and fall, we probably have to re-adjust the head.

46
00:01:35,064 --> 00:01:39,043
Because the #1 obstruction in an unconscious patient is the tongue.

47
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:42,035
Normally this corrects it. They're going to try again.

48
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,075
Then we get chest rise and fall. We know the air went in.

49
00:01:44,075 --> 00:01:46,072
We can continue our chest compressions.

50
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:49,020
We're going to do this until an AED arrives,

51
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,014
or emergency medical services,

52
00:01:51,014 --> 00:01:53,044
or the code team comes and relieves us.

53
00:01:53,044 --> 00:01:58,010
When I get exhausted, I need to indicate to my partner:

54
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,053
we need to change, I'm getting tired.

55
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,082
So after these compressions, let's switch.

56
00:02:02,082 --> 00:02:06,095
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

57
00:02:06,095 --> 00:02:10,064
He gives two more ventilations.

58
00:02:16,013 --> 00:02:18,027
Comes around carefully.

59
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:23,057
I reposition myself with my mask.

60
00:02:23,057 --> 00:02:29,000
and 5, and 6, and 7, and 8 and 9 and 10, and 11, and 12, and 13...

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,070
In this case, I've got a bag valve mask.

62
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,036
If you as a rescuer, or you're in a clinical setting,

63
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:37,098
have a bag valve mask, this is optimally the thing you're going to use.

64
00:02:37,098 --> 00:02:40,004
It doesn't even matter if it doesn't have oxygen.

65
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:43,063
There is some science now showing us that that's not as emphasized

66
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:45,079
anymore in resuscitation cases.

67
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:50,022
But if I have a bag valve mask, I can now use this,

68
00:02:51,035 --> 00:02:54,001
do my C-E method of sealing the mask,

69
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:58,068
give two nice, slow, full breaths,

70
00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:03,057
get chest rise and fall while the rescuer on the compressions continues.

71
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:07,042
And again, we do this until the next level of care comes and relieves us.

72
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:09,090
And we'll keep switching on and off every couple minutes
