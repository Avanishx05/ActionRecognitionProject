17
00:00:00,259 --> 00:00:04,770
I tap and shout. hey hey. are you okay? he doesn't
respond to me.

18
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,350
meaning he doesn't talk to me he's not
moving.

19
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,860
I don't see any breathing or any signs of life.

20
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,990
at that point if I'm by myself

21
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,729
I yell for help. if someone comes
great.

22
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:23,990
I tell them to go and call 911 and get me an AED.

23
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,000
if no one comes then I'm gonna go leave to call 911 and
get an AED.

24
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,940
if no one comes and I saw him fall.

25
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,750
so he clutched his chest and fell on the ground
then

26
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,849
I'm gonna go call right away.

27
00:00:38,849 --> 00:00:44,700
if i didn't see him fall, meaning I walked
up into the room and I found him down

28
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,220
after I did the hey are you okay I'm going
to

29
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,580
stay and I'm gonna do CPR for two minutes before I leave.

30
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,989
so you saw him clutch his chest and fall

31
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:00,160
you leave first. if you didn't see him
clutches his chest and fall

32
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,730
meaning you found him lying on the ground
stay and do 2 minutes of CPR first

33
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,590
then call but only if your by yourself.
Best case scenario

34
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,780
you yell help or there's other people around
you are

35
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,040
gonna send them to go call 911 and get the AED.

36
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,170
so we've established that I've sent someone to go and call 911 

37
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,379
get me an AED. I'm gonna check make sure he's
not breathing.

38
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:27,450
he doesn't appear to be breathing. i'm
looking for chest rise and fall to see if he's breathing.

39
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,900
I don't see any chest fall and rise in this

40
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,069
mannequin here. I'm gonna say he's not
breathing.

41
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:38,290
from there I'm going to start with

42
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,950
my compressions. I'm gonna put the hell
of my palm

43
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:48,349
on the lower half of his breath bone. so
that big bone right in the middle of

44
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:49,200
their chest.

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,920
lower half of it. interlocking my
fingers

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,239
I'm going to press down. 30 compressions.

47
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:03,590
Press at least two inches in an adult. so
if this guy weighs 400 pounds it might

48
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,670
be four inches.

49
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,810
if they weigh only 120 about two inches.

50
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,299
you're going to do it at a rate of at
least a hundred beats

51
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,430
per minute. that's pretty fast. a 100
beats per minute.

52
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,650
so if you know the song stayin alive you can
do that.

53
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,329
if not you do about 30 compressions in
eighteen seconds.

54
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:27,299
that would be great. and you always
have to allow for proper recoil. meaning the chest has

55
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:28,140
to come back

56
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,659
all the way to it's natural position to let
the heart fill with blood.

57
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:36,150
so my 30 compressions are gonna
look like this.

58
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,180


59
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,420


60
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,450


61
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,719


62
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:54,930
30. then i need to give him 2 breaths.

63
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,829
get your pocket mask. remember it has a
teardrop shape.

64
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:03,569
sometimes they'll be so nice they'll
say nose at the top. that goes

65
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:09,609
around the mouth. make some gentle
downward pressure. you don't want to

66
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:11,370
squeeze. you don't want to mash.

67
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,739
just gentle downward pressure. and then you need to

68
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:18,870
tilt to open the airway. deliver two breaths.

69
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,190
I just need to see chest rise and fall.
you don't need to blow up too much.

70
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,340
if you blow up too much it causes air to go
in to their stomach and then that person is gonna

71
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:27,940
vomit.

72
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,819
we don't want that. that would be not so
good for him or you.

73
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:39,000
so two breaths. there's one breath.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:48,229
notice you see chest rise and fall. We're looking to see the
 chest rise and then fall.

75
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:51,530
then I'm gonna go directly back into
doing

76
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,039
30 more compressions.

77
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,229


78
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:02,400


79
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,349

80
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:11,879
go right back into giving two
breaths.
