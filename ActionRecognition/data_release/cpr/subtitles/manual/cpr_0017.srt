9
00:00:01,519 --> 00:00:04,359
surgeon you hear me can you hear me are
you awake

10
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:09,309
that point if we don't get any response
we're going to assess

11
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:14,219
are gonna look for chest rise and fall
we're gonna listen for air movement

12
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,719
through the mouth nose and we're going
to try and feel for

13
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:22,170
a brat on the side or cheek by doing
that we're gonna set their own

14
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,379
and wait for a couple seconds to assess
to make sure that the patients not

15
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:27,199
really have the patience not breathing

16
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,870
I'm gonna have my my partner here
reposition the airway

17
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,250
and reassess in the event no

18
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,859
also bear in mind when you're opening
their way we're going to use a head

19
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:43,110
tilts and left is a medical patient if
it was a trauma patient you typically

20
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,020
use the job for us maneuver

21
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,659
in order to to avoid manipulating the
cervical spine anywhere

22
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:53,240
or potentiating any type of problems I
might already be existing due to the

23
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:53,740
trial

24
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,140
at this point we're gonna say the
patients not breathing

25
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,250
on his own and I'm going to start my
partner here

26
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:05,710
to administer to press risk

27
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:16,250
and then reassess the patient we're also
going to check for a pulse after those

28
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,149
two breasts and if there's no pulse

29
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:21,689
we're going to establish CPR I'll

30
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,100
with hand placement one heal the hand
over the stardom

31
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,820
between the noble line the other hand on
top and we're gonna do

32
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:44,200
30 compressions so want you

33
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,760
then we're gonna ventilated patient
again twice we're going to make sure

34
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,780
that nine on was activated if we're
outside the hospital or away from the

35
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,480
ambulance

36
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,400
and if there's an AED in the area such
as the mauler

37
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,520
like malls are airport way to make sure
that the

38
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,020
they media's is brought to the side of
the patient with us as well

39
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:20,510
and until then we're going to continue
CPR

40
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:42,299

preferably anywhere

44
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:59,030
from 10 to 12 a violations within that
same time frame

45
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,840
after every five cycles a CPR gonna
check appalls

46
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,260
and we're going to continue to do CPR
until the ad- rise on CAD arise if it

47
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:07,730
