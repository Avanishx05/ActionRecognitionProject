17
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,630
the first step in responding to this medical emergency is surveying the scene. 

18
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,520
quickly survey the scene to see if there is anything harmful around or 

19
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,630
blood on the victim and even poisonous fumes.

20
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,270
if your victim has blood on or around them it is very important

21
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,710
to put on gloves and keep the blood from contacting your skin.

22
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,759
after carefully surveying the scene

23
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:29,860
proceed to gently shaking the

24
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:35,060
victim and asking if he or she is okay.

25
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,320
from there we move on to the second step which is contacting 

26
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,259
EMS. it is very important to stay with your victim at all costs.

27
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:45,390
so tell a designated person nearby

28
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,350
to contact EMS. hey can you contact EMS for me.

29
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,960
if there is nobody around

30
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,299
then you have to contact EMS on your own.

31
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:01,119
the third and final step is administrating CPR. 

32
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,350
slowly move the victim's body

33
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,600
to a stable position

34
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,020
and then position yourself at the victim's

35
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,860
shoulders. slowly move the victim and check

36
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:21,260
their pulse.

37
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,680
proceed to doing your ABC's which stands for airway, breathing and

38
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,470
circulation. tilt the head

39
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,690
to open the airway and lean closely to the victim's mouth for any

40
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,990
signs of brething.

41
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,550
if the victim has any signs of breathing roll him or her over and

42
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,920
wait for medical professionals to get here.

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,370
but if there are no signs of breathing you have to quickly perform

44
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:53,790
CPR. with

45
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,700
rescue breathing first. the best way to give

46
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:03,110
rescue breathing is the mouth to mouth technique. Start by pinching the person's nose

47
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,620
and tilting the head back and keeping the chin lifted up.

48
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,020
then make an airtight seal with your mouth

49
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:17,230
on the victim and then give two quick breaths. then
check

50
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:22,520
for their pulse.

51
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,820
after the two breaths if there is still no breathing from the victim

52
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,110
then you will have to perform Chest
compressions.

53
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,950
with the heel of your hand on the sternum or the middle of the chest and your

54
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,900
fingers interlocked on the chest, keep your arms completely
straight

55
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:54,330
and do 15 reps of chest compressions.

56
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,630
then check for the pulse again.

57
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,209
if there's still no breathing, do the mouth to mouth

58
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:08,030
one more time

59
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:18,360
and 15 compressions

60
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,750
and check for the pulse again.

61
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,640
repeat this cycle until 4 times or until the victim is

62
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,240
now breathing or wait until the medical emergency people get here.
