30
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,040
check to make sure there is no immediate
or further danger to the rescuer

31
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,810
other personnel or the casualty check
for a response

32
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,360
try two-week the casualty

33
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,580
raise an alarm and call 911 immediately

34
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:21,760
and see if the casualty is breathing if
the casualties breathing normally

35
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,450
place them in the recovery position

36
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:35,520
wait for medical attention to arrive and
monitor their condition regularly

37
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,860
if the casualties

38
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,010
breathing normally you will have to
immediately commence

39
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,780
CPR for demonstration purposes

40
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,470
we will use this manikin first

41
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,489
you should kneel alongside the casualty
in a position that will allow you to

42
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:53,690
comfortably apply

43
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,550
vertical pressure during compressions

44
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,310
next visualize where the center the
casualties chest is

45
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:05,930
then place the he love one hand on that
point in the center of the chest

46
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,800
this achieves our aim of placing the he
loved one hand on the chest

47
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,420
above the heart keep that hand in
position

48
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,200
and police say he love the other hand on
top of the first hand

49
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,480
and interlock your fingers at the hands
like this

50
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,220
alternatively you can grasp around the
wrist up the first and

51
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:31,530
like this either method is acceptable be
sure not to apply any pressure over the

52
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,790
casualties ribs

53
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,890
abdomen or the bottom end up there
sternum

54
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:41,220
as this can cause damage to internal
organs when performing compressions

55
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,549
you should pivot from the hips that is
you should not be rocking back and forth

56
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:51,569
position yourself so that you are
directly above the casualties chest

57
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,640
you're compressing arm should be kept
straight

58
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,780
your bottom hand should remain in
contact with the casualties chest

59
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,239
and your shoulder will be directly above
the chest

60
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,260
when compressions are delivered
compressions should be rhythmic

61
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,620
with equal time for compression and
relaxation

62
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,049
and you should allow the chest to recall
oil completely
