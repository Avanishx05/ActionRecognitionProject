13
00:00:00,139 --> 00:00:04,199
sir it the victim does not respond and
the victims not breathing

14
00:00:04,199 --> 00:00:08,049
were not breathing normal line 110 for
someone to call 911 okay

15
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:12,679
and have been getting a TD an AED is a
portable electronic device

16
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:16,329
that helps the heart returned to its
normal rhythm if you're alone

17
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:21,850
call 911 and get the ED yourself then
follow the ET's boys proms

18
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:26,039
it now ED is available immediately start
CPR

19
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,680
beginning with compressions doing CPR is
not hard

20
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,250
anyone can do it and now the American
Heart Association

21
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,409
is making CPR easier than ever we used
to tell people

22
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:41,780
that the proper steps for CPR are airway
reaping compressions

23
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,130
or ABC we change that order

24
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,880
to the compressions come first it's now
compressions

25
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,719
airway reading RCA be this new order
makes it easier

26
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,869
because anybody can start out with
compression even with no CPR training

27
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:01,259
just push hard and fast from the center
the chest

28
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:04,999
if you haven't trained keep pushing
until help arrives

29
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:08,810
when you give compressions make sure you
push the chest down

30
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:14,749
at least 2 inches and allow a little
time for the chest to come back up

31
00:01:14,749 --> 00:01:18,369
pushes hard and fast as you can the
perfect

32
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:22,939
rate per compressions is at least 100
per minute at the same speed

33
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:27,670
as the Beatles song stayin alive so try
to keep that in your head that helps

34
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,799
if you've been trained in CPR push in
the chest

35
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,400
thirty times in open the airway by
tilting head back

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,330
and lifting the chair is how to reach
the lines

37
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,950
next give to mouth to mouth brass over
one second preach braque

38
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,930
and watch for the chance to rise here
continue to see a b-cycle

39
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:53,580
until help porn a derives use the same
CA be cycle for adults
