10
00:00:01,269 --> 00:00:04,789
step 1: check when you check the scene

11
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:09,100
you want to make sure that is the for
you wanna make sure you did not come

12
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:09,940
into

13
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:15,269
so i'll check for safety then check for
the number vacant how many victims you

14
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:15,699
have

15
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:19,170
clues as to what could have happened
head

16
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,570
look around for other bystanders who can
help you go

17
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,659
to the victim and find out if they are
unconscious this way to find out

18
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:32,610
fitness conscious or not is you talk to
them they don't stop

19
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,210
show up and see if they respond to you

20
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,770
step 2 call

21
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,930
if they are unconscious or any other
life-threatening condition

22
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,890
you are going to you automatically go to
the next step

23
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,530
which is calling 911 preferably

24
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,130
if you have somebody yell wanna be
bystanders you can send them

25
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,260
to call 911

26
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,080
step 3: care

27
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,920
the third step that we're going to
follow is that cares to care for the

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,490
condition

29
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,550
fine this is where we going to refer to
the ABC's

30
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,710
care the airway breeding in circulation

31
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,110
step 4: a for airway

32
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:18,299
I'm going to open air able to the airway
till the head back this teacher

33
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,400
I only know love you worry me

34
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,630
Warner warrant has a I want

35
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,300
31 more mild

36
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,869
when acid

37
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:35,450
step 5: be for breathing

38
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,959
there is no breeding able to might be
step

39
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,959
which is the two rescue breaths 3 shield
on their

40
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,980
from barrier between myself to take me
again

41
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,370
avoiding contact with anyone was a date
engine OSA

42
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,640
killed the head back 50 GN and you

43
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:01,580
to breast those press about one

44
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,660
once they long now the breast when here
that tells me there's no blockage

45
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,640
I am going to look over the body see if
there's any bleeding

46
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,780
and begin CPR if the brats did not go in

47
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,840
the victim is choking and the airways
obstructed attempt to remove the

48
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,570
obstruction

49
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:23,510
and follow the steps for unconscious
choking step 6:

50
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,150
seed for circulation the Red Cross
prefers that lay persons no longer

51
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,040
checked for a pulse on an adult

52
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,519
so checking for circulation in a victim
involves watching them for coughing

53
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:39,040
movement or normal breathing if there
are no visible signs rescuers should

54
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,430
begin CPR

55
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,670
step 7 CPR

56
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,840
we begin CPR compressions on the adult

57
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,280
we're going to do 30 compressions and to
press

58
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,780
we're going to do the other five times
in two minutes

59
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,109
to perform chest compressions on an
adult place that he loved one hand on

60
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:00,760
the center the person's chest

61
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,290
between the Naples keeping your elbows
straight place your other hand on top of

62
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,230
the first hand

63
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,719
with your shoulders above your hand push
straight down and compress the chest

64
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,249
about one and a half to two inches

65
00:03:14,249 --> 00:03:17,850
step 8 stopping CPR

66
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,960
was weak we began CPR we never stop

67
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,590
we do not stop to recheck we just
continue without stopping

68
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,110
until week notice life picked up

69
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,160
amazing in this movie causing breathing

70
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,360
I'll moaning anything that would

71
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,520
indicate that the person is alive do not
confuse bonding with us on a life that's

72
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,270
nice I'm

73
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:46,230
step 9 recovery now we are going to

74
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,650
get this are so that it supports his way
here

75
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,330
and in the media this case the victim
from continuing to roll

76
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,150
and the the speed away from the floor

77
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,480
if they happen to vomit or past-life
throughout

78
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,850
all that will drano now wait for rescue
personnel to arrive
