5
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:14,440
No response, call 911. I'm going to open the
airway; look, listen and feel for ten seconds.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:29,149
I don't see or feel any breathing, I'm going
to go ahead and give a ventilation now. And

7
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:46,969
I have adequate chest rise, I will give a
second ventilation. Again adequate chest rise.

8
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:54,250
I'm going to go ahead and reassess for carotid
pulse for five to ten seconds. No pulse. I'm

9
00:00:54,250 --> 00:01:02,340
going to now begin CPR. I want to make sure
that I move my patient to a hard surface,

10
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:32,440
still maintaining my airway, find my one third;
4 and 5 and 6 and 7 and 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,

11
00:01:32,440 --> 00:02:11,260
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,
24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. (giving breaths

12
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:11,359
and start pumping again) 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9
and 10, and 11, and 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

13
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:11,680
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28,
29, 30. (giving breaths) I have just completed

14
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,569
two cycles of my ratio of thirty two compressions.
You want to do approximately four of those

15
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,049
which will take about two minutes. At the
end of that I am now going to reassess my

16
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:23,799
patient. I don't need to check for responsiveness
cause I can tell my patient don't have no

17
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:38,180
change in it. I do though want to look listen
and feel. Still no response. It didn't get

18
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:52,590
my first ventilation in. I want to make sure
I reposition the head.
Two adequate ventilations, assess for a pulse.

19
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:58,939
If still no pulse, I will continue CPR and
wait for EMS to arrive. If there was a pulse

20
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:03,459
it is safe to say that you should give another
round of CPR for at least two more minutes

21
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:07,409
just to kind of help the heart, it has just
been restarted and it could use your help

22
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:12,419
assisting it while pumping. If the patient
does at any point wake up though it safe to

23
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:13,939
say you can stop your CPR.
