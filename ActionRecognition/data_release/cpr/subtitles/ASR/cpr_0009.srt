from there I'm going to start with

42
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,950
my compression morning put the he'll
love my palm

43
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:48,349
on the lower half up his breath bomb so
that big bomb right in the middle of

44
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:49,200
their chest

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,920
lower half ovett K interlocking my
fingers

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,239
I'm going to press down 30 compressions

47
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:03,590
Press at least two inches in an adult so
if this guy weighs 400 pounds it might

48
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,670
be four inches

49
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,810
if they weigh only 120 about two inches

50
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,299
K you're going to do it at a rate of at
least a hundred beats

51
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,430
per minute that's pretty bad the 100
beats per minute

52
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,650
so we know the song stayin alive you can
do that

53
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,329
if not you know about 30 compressions in
eighteen seconds

54
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:27,299
that would be a great K and you always
want to lock up a requirement in HS have

55
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:28,140
to come back

56
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,659
all the way with natural position to let
the Hartree fill with blood

57
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:36,150
sup might their impressions are gonna
look like this

58
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,180
one to 3 4 back 6 7

30 any given to press

63
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,829
care POC in math remember it has a
teardrop shape

64
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:03,569
sometimes they'll be so nice and only if
they know that the top that goes

65
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:09,609
already know around now make congenital
downward pressure you don't want to

66
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:11,370
squeeze you know one in mass

67
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,739
just dental canceled our pressure any to

68
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:18,870
tilt the open airway deliver to breath

69
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,190
I just need to teach us rise and fall
you need to blow up too much

70
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,340
people not too much it causes air to go
to their stomach in a person is gonna

71
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:27,940
balmy

72
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,819
we don't want that that would be not so
good for him or you

73
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:39,000
so to breath there's one where

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:48,229
noted CCHS I don't bother looking at
cedar chest right and then fall

75
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:51,530
then I'm gonna go directly back into
doing

76
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,039
30 more compression point to 3

77
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,229
