4
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,170
laying on the ground appears to be
having problem the first thing that you

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,190
wanted to use to make sure that you are
safe

6
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,810
if you're safe you can approach the
person

7
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,820
and the first thing we want to do is
establish responsiveness

8
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,070
went to gently placed her hands on a
person's chast

9
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,120
and chic yell are you okay

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,190
are you okay if there's no response from
the individual

11
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,280
we can presume that they need help
sometimes

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,860
the second stop is to somehow hell

13
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:38,560
so many activate 911 once we know that
help is coming

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,649
then we can start to help the patient if
there's nobody around nobody

15
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,840
there too to go get help we need to go
get help

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,329
we want to call call 911 tell whether
the person is

17
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,240
and then come back so the first then ass
out
