28
00:00:01,119 --> 00:00:06,279
got Joe graphic Joe and he doesn't
respond so we need to move on

29
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:10,780
to the next step the next step is
calling 911

30
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,230
when you call 911 you need to make sure
that you give them as much information

31
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,280
as possible

32
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,560
so they are able to help you you also
should never

33
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,790
here operator first because if you do
they may know

34
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,599
%uh might not have all information that
they need to come to that

35
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:31,340
rescue also if there are other people
around you should have them call 911 and

36
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,380
tell them what to do

37
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,780
so you are able to move on to the next
step more efficiently

38
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,230
and quicker the next three steps

39
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,600
have an acronym no to see AB or cat the
first

40
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,930
letter for that see and you do
compressions

41
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,180

30 compressions at a rate of 100
compressions per minute

46
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,880
the Dept the compression should be at
least two inches

47
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,530
so if this occurs gradual this is what
happened and you should also count aloud

48
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:15,910
