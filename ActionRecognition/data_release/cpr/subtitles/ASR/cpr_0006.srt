2
00:00:01,509 --> 00:00:04,769
Always make sure the scene is safe for you and the victim.

3
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:09,080
Check for response by tapping the victim's shoulder and shout, "Are you okay?"

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,310
If there is no response, that is, if the victim is unresponsive and not breathing,

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,740
or only gasping,

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,130
activate emergency medical services

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,439
and get or call for an AED.

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,180
Immediately start the chest compressions.

9
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,370
Push hard and fast, at a rate of at least 100 compressions per minute.

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,120
Count out loud "1, 2, 3, 4, 5"

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,000
up to 30 compressions.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,970
Push the chest at least 2 inches deep with each compression.

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,339
After 30 compressions,

14
00:00:37,339 --> 00:00:39,730
open the airway using the head tilt/chin lift

15
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,510
method,

16
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,750
then give two

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,800
mouth to mouth breaths.

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,680
Deliver air over one second to make the victim's chest rise.

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,940
Give one breath

20
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,220
every five to six seconds

21
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,770
for a rate of 10-12 breaths per minute.

22
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,289
Continue 30 compressions

23
00:00:57,289 --> 00:00:58,980
followed by 2 ventilations

24
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,320
for a ratio of 30:2.

25
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,490
The AED should be used as soon as it is available.

26
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:05,240
Resume chest

27
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,240
compressions immediately after the shock is given.

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,360
For adult CPR, the ratio of compression to ventilation is 30:2 for both

29
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,700
one and two rescuers.

30
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,050
For two rescuers,

31
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,230
change the compressor every two minutes

32
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,090
or every 5 cycles to avoid fatigue.

33
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,990
Rescuers should try to change the compressor role

34
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,360
in less than 5 seconds.
