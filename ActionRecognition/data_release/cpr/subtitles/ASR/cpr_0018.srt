8
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,960
I love resuscitation and thats airway
breathing

9
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,090
circulation into fibrillation so first
thing I come up here you okay you okay

10
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,120
I make sure this person just again not
sleeping in the park

11
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,870
and make sure they're actually
unconscious there's no response I don't

12
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,989
see any movement I don't see any
breathing

13
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:23,280
when i activate the UMass system and
when I say help

14
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,820
somebody call 911 my point to somebody
you over there

15
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,879
go call 911 come back when you're done

16
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:33,120
this way we know that there's an
ambulance on the way

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,390
so we can get to help soon as possible

18
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,150
now I'm going to open the airway and
look listen and feel for breeding

19
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:45,210
as I talk to head back to put my hand on
the up on the forehead

20
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,400
put my fingers here on the bony
prominence to the chin

21
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,740
and I tilt the head back and bring the
time now the airway

22
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,600
and I'm gonna look listen and feel free
breathing looking at the chest thing if

23
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,820
the chest is rising

24
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,220
and listening for any air movement thing
if I feel any air movement

25
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,770
if no that's going to occur then I'm
gonna deliver two breaths

26
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:11,509
too nice for brats

27
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:15,740
another air to get the chest to rise if
you don't feel comfortable sticking your

28
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,200
mouth on the mouth were

29
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,500
another person you could use a
commercially available pocket mask

30
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,060
you can get most to these at pharmacy or
someplace like that

31
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,560
and you basically place the sort on the
the patient's face

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,740
any and you tilt your head back

33
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,250
mom but you're going to use your thumbs
to help hold this on the person's face

34
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:44,899
and then you gonna breathe inside still
delivering two breaths

35
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:49,890
alright so after the two breaths goin'

36
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,420
began looking for any signs a
circulation they're not moving

37
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,730
they're not talking arise then open up
for anything like that

38
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,400
I'm gonna go ahead and perform
compressions I'm gonna bring my

39
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,890
my hand basically in line with their
nipples right on their breast bone right

40
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,890
here on the sternum

41
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:11,900
and I'm gonna press down 30 times and
press hard in the press fast and press

42
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,910
down about an inch and a half to two
inches

43
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,370
up

44
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:26,480

times

45
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,050
