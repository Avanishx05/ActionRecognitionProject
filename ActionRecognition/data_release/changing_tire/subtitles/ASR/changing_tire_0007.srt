1 
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,170
you can change the way your cell
everything in a dozen the boat

2 
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:13,020
spare wheel Jack and we'll price there's
also a socket to fit a locking bolts on

3 
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:13,919
other whales

4 
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,180
stop by flak in NH bout by halftime

5 
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,059
like eight the jacket the mounting point

6 
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:25,460
a sign in the owners manual and left the
car so the wheel

7 
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:31,059
is clear ground remove the bolts and
then the whale

8 
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:34,190
much to the spares nowadays off by
savers

9 
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,220
I must only be used to get to the
nearest car repair a

10 
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:42,340
and a maximum speed limit applies place
a spare wheel imposition

11 
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,579
and hand tighten the bolts moderately
tight match boat using the wheel brakes

12 
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,780
lower the car and from a project now

13 
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,570
fully tighten the bolts in across
sequences shine and they have it back

14 
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,219
alright

15 
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:03,479
just a few points to mention the call
must be on level solid ground the hand

16 
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,310
brake applied

17 
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:08,710
and ideally free if passengers and pets
because any internal movement could

18 
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,740
cause the vehicle to become unstable

19 
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,780
if you're on the highway then use the
hazard warning lights

20 
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,090
and a warning triangle if you have fun
butts if you're not busy mine wrote on

21 
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:19,909
my 2i

22 
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:23,440
your personal safety is going to be at
risk and don't attempt to change the way

23 
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,799
yourself call for recovery services
instead
