00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:42,559
second thing you want to do

12 
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,570
is to use your hand unscrew the track

13 
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,020
in a counter-clockwise motion to loosen

unscrew the spare tire but

16 
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,210
up the

17 
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,830
I

18 
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:17,830
in with the spare tire out

19 
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,120

this is broken and used to loosen the
lug nuts and tighten the locals

24 
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,330
this tool

we're going to use to jack the car
upping their as we need

26 
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:50,040
the next step is to loosen the nuts

27 
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,920
at least 14 her because when you jack
the car up

28 
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,470
before you lose their nuts that arm I
heard that would be make it here

29 
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:04,470
or here

30 
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,650
the next thing we want to do is to jack
the car

31 
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,910
safety reasons you need to make sure
that you jack it up from the correct

32 
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,530
place

33 
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,730

to take the bottom knots

44 
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:30,769

45 
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:35,049

55 
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:42,310

56 
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,530

00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:36,520
now that we're done with that staff
everything's tight you wanna

63 
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,990
physically check to make sure the tires
got enough air pressure and it

64 
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,699
and it's ready to drive now we need to
put the tools back in the way that we

65 
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:45,169
fail

66 
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:52,169
the first thing we want to do is put the
tire back in the compartment

67 
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,850

back in here

68 
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,140

its place

70 
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,780

72 
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,330
we're going to put the tools

73 
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,210
