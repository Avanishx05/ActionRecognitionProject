1 
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,340
do is to remove these plastic

2 
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,259
caps that go over the actual knots yes
they do not like the actual not

3 
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,039
themselves

4 
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:13,269
but they're not right there off

5 
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:17,019
don't check out with at least in the
Knox but

6 
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:20,400
his when you try and do them the wheel
would just turn on red

7 
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,989
it sounds obvious I've done it this was
in its okay

8 
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:29,030
its 3.2 K for the wall locking wheel not
which we need to release first so let's

9 
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,390
make sure that same position

10 
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,400
now I could have used the standard will
grace is lightweight one that came with

11 
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,019
the Cal

12 
00:00:35,019 --> 00:00:38,299
this is a standard issue on you need to
have had

13 
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:43,389
a decent breakfast if you can use one of
these I'm a reasonably robust lot but

14 
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:45,250
what I'm gonna do is rely instead

15 
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,709
and what i think is safer which is one
of these aftermarket wheel brakes is we

16 
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:51,220
can get two hands on a

17 
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,470
and we can exert some real leverage so
let's get this one of first

18 
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,569
F

19 
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:01,849
the write some loose in these of

20 
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:08,519
but I'm not mad set them off completely

21 
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:12,389
because I do not want this whale to come
off

22 
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:15,080
when I don't want it to

23 
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,060
the normally Bay almost always

24 
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,250
those instructions in various languages
on here

25 
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,840
sio2 use this jack where it goes most
importantly where it goes

26 
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,010
you tryin raise the whole way to this
vehicle

27 
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,040
by putting this in the wrong place
component to the bodywork you really

28 
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,750
don't want to do that

29 
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,380
was stale taken the a danger to see if
the person is changing the oil

30 
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,530
so about a look and it tells me that
there's a

31 
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,330
on the sale hey a that's depression
where that goes

32 
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:50,150
so there it is some got that in

33 
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:57,150
nice and tie just think it's right there
ripe

34 
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,380
one thing as well if you are you need of
other people

35 
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,690
with you for goodness sake make them get
out the car

36 
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,970
or if they're in the car the children
and their in the car make sure they stay

37 
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,030
in the car

38 
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,130
the last thing you on when you check in
for cars

39 
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,419
people in closing doors unnecessarily
getting in and out to the vehicle

40 
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:24,010
right let's get this way of

41 
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,680
just put least one side is nothing worse

42 
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,710
again offer to his job in fine at the
applause from the oval

43 
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:40,710
right let's take the space ever on

44 
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,700
this crime resistance the space efforts
I is

45 
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,650
I'm wheels when they first came out a
few years ago well as well as having the

46 
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,360
advantage is liberated space

47 
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,280
inside the car I'm reducing weight which
reduces your fuel consumption and

48 
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,700
improve your performance

49 
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,190
they're all so much easier to handle
wheels and tires have got bigger and

50 
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,220
bigger and bigger

51 
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,490
I'm heavier and so the space evas all
kinds advantage but for goodness sake

52 
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,940
look at it it's perfectly safe ball

53 
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,090
don't leave it on your car for a few
weeks

54 
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,630
I don't wanna see you in the car park at
the supermarket loading up the car with

55 
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,789
one of these things on

56 
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:23,240
once you go into the zone the only place
you need to be going

57 
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,450
is tie specialist for your dealership
just cite names of an eye

58 
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,250
I don't think I'll put the plastic cups
back on because I'm only going to be

59 
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,050
leaving it on for as long as it takes me
to get to a dealer

60 
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:40,120
now on site are all on see simply put
them on think it's I

61 
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,479
first and that's a good way stocks in
them off so that you going into the

62 
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,940
existing thread you're not

63 
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,280
eyes it's a cross threading the hope you
don't want to force the ball seemed to

64 
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,180
start with however once you've got the
whole thing it's I

65 
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,479
it is good practice get hola tyo atop a
ABC space ever like this

66 
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,620
just give them a twist intern

67 
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,960
with the wheel brace so that the wheel

68 
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,090
isn't moving around its all the wheels
nice and secure

69 
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,240
and let the Jak II and then I'll
probably tighten those

70 
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:18,240
five boats make sure these wheels on
right

71 
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:23,860
I still a jack i night at the wheel

72 
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,620
aids family legrand Chinese knots

73 
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,830
as much pressure as you can apply what
are these away a

74 
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,140
will dresses only about ties it needs
today

75 
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:40,480
retrying these up by the way tryin Titan
opposite to opposite instead of going

76 
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,590
round the clock

77 
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,070
to make sure that it's squarely on the
hope

78 
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,190
right that all Titan the really secure
is pumped up I'm ready for the road

79 
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:49,540
again
