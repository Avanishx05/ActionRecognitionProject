1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,630
the her on Stanley

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,389
rowdy need account in a segment we'll be
talking about changing a flat tire

3
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:11,870
certainly is inconvenient but we're
gonna walk you through it step by step

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:16,500
the don't discover to access the spare
tire ok

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,250
well or listen it got the whole down and
give it a couple good ramp-up

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,660
make sure its full-year where so you
want to do is put on a flat spare

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,400
the new rule on the tire campus can be
quite happy

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,270
well have a spare tire jack we set a
reflective warning signal out

9
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,100
we've all sold talk the wheel on the
opposite side of the flat tire

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,250
so ready to start changing it the first
thing will do is jacked the vehicle a

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,390
you have to loosen the jack a little bit
in order to get the handle of

12
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:53,390
this particular model has La Grange
built rate inched before we jacked they

13
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,410
would want to loosen the lug nuts
because once is jacked up it's going to

14
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,320
be very difficult to get those lug nuts
are

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,940
this particular model has a hubcap which
will just loosen those up

16
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,040
Oct doesn't take much to the made out of
plastic

17
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,210
took the hubcap hardware

18
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:16,750
now have access to the lugnuts loosen
the lug nuts

19
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,750
this yourself permalink pressing

20
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,540
counterclockwise loosen the lug nuts

21
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,049
not to lose just enough the crack up

22
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:30,720
there's a little stubborn position
yourself over

23
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,159
using your knee or your foot you can
gain leverage

24
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,409
now ready to jack it up this is a common
scissors check

25
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:43,500
the screws in and out allowing the Matt
mechanism to move up and down and lift

26
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,110
your car

27
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,979
so as you turn it to the right it'll go
up as you listen it

28
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:54,030
the jackal collapse allowing the car to
come down now opposition to Jack

29
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,950
you want to be sure to get the Jacka a
good part of the frame

30
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,119
the owners manuals a good place to find
where to properly checked the vehicle

31
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,700
crew can raise it up by hand

32
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:13,700
to contact the frame is in good position
will use the jack handle to raise the

33
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,209
vehicle

34
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:18,349
insert the end of the jack handle into
the jet

35
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:21,610
using it as leverage it'll help make the
car go up easier

36
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,140
member turn it clockwise to go up and
counterclockwise to go down

37
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,840
carefully jack the car up never stick
your hands or legs

38
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,680
under the vehicle as the car can fall on
'cause damaged

39
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,879
checking can take a while so be patient
cautious as you jack

40
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:46,769
okay now that the car's jacked up no
take the lead not salutes

41
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:50,879
remember we are you pre lucinda when the
car was on the ground making it easy

42
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,180
know so come right off now trying to do
that while the car was jacked up would

43
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,230
be very difficult

44
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,540
member to keep your lug nuts and close
hand you don't wanna roll away and

45
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,129
addressed it will be hard to find that
will hold retire on

46
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:10,550
again we're turning them
counterclockwise to get them lose

47
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:17,440
or to the left will remove the

48
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,840
flat tire said it over here are the way

49
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,440
now there's heavy traffic area you would
want to leave it in the street you might

50
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,860
want to put it to the rear of the car

51
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,440
grab the spare tire put it in position

52
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,900
you gonna Center the spare tire on the
wheel stud

53
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,450
let alone its go to go ahead and do that
up

54
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,930
on lining it up you see lines are pretty
easy

55
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,260
finished all your lug nuts again

56
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,750
clockwise just take on a clockwise is
loose

57
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,980
so what item up by hand

58
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,989
as far as logo just

59
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:01,430
once a tire center

60
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,680
look not so hang tight take the lug
wrench

61
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,010
again turning it clockwise

62
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,019
tighten the lug tiller firm

63
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:15,069
not too tight because really occurs up
on a jet we would wanna falling off with

64
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:16,370
too much leverage a force

65
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:20,790
Oct

66
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:27,790
insert the jack and a back into the jack

67
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,800
turning it counterclockwise again we're
gonna lower the vehicle

68
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,419
again it'll take some time but going
down a lot easier than going up

69
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:40,639
if it seems to go down easy you can just
do it like this by doing it straight

70
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,900
instead having an angled

71
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,590
but if it's too tough you can angle at
and get the leverage that you need to

72
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,410
lower the jack

73
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,110
to raise the jacked Turner Jack low
enough

74
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,740
he can do it by hand now that it doesn't
have contact with the frame

75
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,810
and we can remove it now that the tires
on the ground we'll go ahead given that

76
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:58,800
final tight

77
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,150
we're gonna start down here then moved
to the top one then back down

78
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:08,250
over and bakie get a little star pattern
making sure we have equal torque

79
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,830
on the wheel stud

80
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,380
okay well we have a spare tire on a tear
it up

81
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,229
we're ready to go couple things to
remember those who are producing back in

82
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:19,870
the trunk

83
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,180
you know one XE highway speed on this
temporary spare make sure you get the

84
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,270
big tire fixed

85
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,630
you get you back on the road as soon as
possible amounts family
