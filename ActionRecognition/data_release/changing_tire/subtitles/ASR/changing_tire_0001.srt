1 
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,930
owners manual thing can learn where and
how

2 
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,570
to use your spare tire the tires are
having

3 
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,630
that

4 
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,229
these are you tools to help you jack up
your car

5 
00:00:17,229 --> 00:00:20,250
and to take the old flat tire

6 
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,410
in Hansen

7 
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,320
it up to me right here the gap some
using the wheel wrench you're going to

8 
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,649
loosen the not perhaps expert

9 
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:34,649
remember

10 
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:40,009
lefty loosey right inside it

11 
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:44,049
and you can see the jacking point is
this part right here on the frame

12 
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:47,049
do it

13 
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:51,200
now as you remember we first loosen the
wheel nut I have turned

14 
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,590
all the way around for weed jack the car
so now we're going to do is come

15 
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:02,229
fully remove the wheel not and take off
the wheel pattern

16 
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:08,930
and its I their website

17 
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,920
editing thing

18 
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,319
there's nothing you can do the sweetest
do

19 
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:16,959
here be wanting it to you higher job

20 
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,500
yet me the first question you may have

21 
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,380
is which side they said out

22 
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,530
and the easiest way to check that the

23 
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,970
a rebel Lodi right here

24 
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:38,959
always been outside then

25 
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,830
take the wheel wrench course very
important to get these on

26 
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,260
as tight as you can see you make it
safely to a tire shop

27 
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,730
sign out going too slowly to lower the
car backed up

28 
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,940
you're gonna get dirty I hate Italia

29 
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,410
lab clean job art if you remember

30 
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,470
the trunk is where we found the spare
and now we're gonna put the flat iron

31 
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:04,150
here with all of our equipment and head
down the road to the tire shop

32 
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:09,130
to have an expert check things out after
packing the bad tire in the trunk

33 
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,820
I carefully throw over a in our tires
and then Monica
