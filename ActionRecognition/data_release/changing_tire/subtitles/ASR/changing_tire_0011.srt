1 
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,450
step 1: when changing a tire it is
important to pick a location with a

2 
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,890
solid level ground to ensure the
stability of the vehicle when he nap

3 
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:08,790
time

4 
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,400
in our situation we are on concrete so
we will not have to worry about

5 
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,250
ok however if you are in an emergency
situation

6 
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,020
like your tire blew on the highway call
over to the right hand shoulder on the

7 
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,890
road and turn your hazard lights on

8 
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:27,330
I ok make sure that your vehicle remains
on the concrete work

9 
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,539
if a car is jacked up on the sand or
dirt portion of the shoulder

10 
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,800
the jack will sink which can cause
damage to the vehicle as well as

11 
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,380
threatening you're sick

12 
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,680
if you drive an automatic put the
vehicle in park ok

13 
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,899
and apply the emergency brake ok if you
drive a standard vehicle

14 
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:48,000
place the car in first year and apply
the emergency brake

15 
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,020
ok step to you locate the necessary
tools needed to change a tire on your

16 
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,280
some vehicles require

17 
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,000
locking wheel nut before traveling
ensure that you are aware that the

18 
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,879
location of this

19 
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,899
without it you will not be able to
remove the law

20 
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,310
like the most common story care for
these materials is the trunk of the

21 
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,700
vehicle

22 
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,369
left the carpet and procedure move the
spare tire

23 
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:17,310
and the tire most vehicles will have the
jacket family

24 
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,270
underneath the carpet as well but in the
case of this vehicle

25 
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:28,270
stored I on the left hand side

26 
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,510
step 3: start with the jack by placing
it under the frame

27 
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:41,530
fire that K it's important to ensure
that the jackets contact in the frame

28 
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,690
directly to avoid damage to the site
scared the majority of modern vehicles

29 
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,970
have a designated area

30 
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,150
near you well designated area is usually
a

31 
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,520
in 12 in this case it'd ended she got a
truck or older people

32 
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,150
there may not be a controlled available
if this is the case jack the vehicle up

33 
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,770
from a friend step toward

34 
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,500
proceed to raise the jack onto the pinch
welds or frame into the car is firmly

35 
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,250
supported

36 
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,750
actually being lazy into the air at this
time

37 
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,900
make sure that the jack is firmly
planted on the ground so that it will

38 
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,360
not ship do step 5:

39 
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,270
locate the love not on your vehicle if
your vehicle has hubcaps or a center cap

40 
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,620
you may have to pry them off depending
on the design from here

41 
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,580
not not should be loosened but not
completely removed and you can see

42 
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,700
the lot not on the far right is a
locking lug nut this is why you want me

43 
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,900
but locking key

44 
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,260
in able to remove from here love not
should be loosened but not completely

45 
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,130
removed

46 
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,970
breaking their insistence that the
lugnuts may take quite a bit of course

47 
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:51,970
depending on how tight they are

48 
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:59,250
ok

49 
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,530
step 6:

50 
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,940
full erase the car of the gallon by
pumping or in this case

51 
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,110
cranking the CAC the amount of clearance
that you want between your tire and the

52 
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,650
ground

53 
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:15,650
should be enough you can freely remove
the tire

54 
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,750
step 7:

55 
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,930
removed a lot not completely off the hub
the people

56 
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:39,930
this may take some time be patient

57 
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,690
a quick can't is to ensure that you
remember where you put

58 
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,050
the lugnuts there's nothing worse than
losing the lugnuts

59 
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:18,420
when you try to put the tire back on

60 
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,000
stat 8 from movie tired there may be
some resistance when trying to take off

61 
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,710
the tire

62 
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,550
this is often the case when it is winter
and water freezes between the wheel and

63 
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,010
hub

64 
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,910
don't be afraid to give it a good night
sharking ok

65 
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,570
step 9: take the spare tire and place it
on to the hob

66 
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:41,900
matching the holes on the wall to the
weekend no debt

67 
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,150
10 place the logs onto the stud that
you're tired

68 
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,950
tricky to hand tighten the lug nuts
until they are snug again

69 
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:52,190
this may take some time be patient

70 
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:59,190
child

71 
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:13,980
the

72 
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:29,289
the

73 
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:32,259
step 11 tighten a lot not securely

74 
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:36,659
for this five lug assembly the procedure
in tightening the lugnuts

75 
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:40,300
will be a star pattern to ensure that
the bill is flushed with the hub

76 
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:40,879
assembly

77 
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,249
if you don't do the star pattern

78 
00:05:44,249 --> 00:05:51,249
you could run the risk that the only off
on off

79 
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,009
step 12 lower the jack bringing the car
onto the ground

80 
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:06,389
we tighten the lug nuts find them as
much as you can

81 
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:10,570
but not overtaking them preventing you
from removing the lug nuts in the future

82 
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,350
if you purchase a new wheel assembly it
is best to have it installed

83 
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,350
professionally

84 
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:22,350
so that you can tighten the wheel to
specifications

85 
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:35,280
for

86 
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,520
step 13:

87 
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,690
but all the materials and tools back in
there location
