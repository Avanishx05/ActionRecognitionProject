under the vehicle retrieve it following
the steps in your owner's manual

7 
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,519
it's a good idea to check the spares
pressure before you go any farther

8 
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,330
if your spares pressure is good continue
on with changing your plan

9 
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,570
by popping off the cover to access the
lug nuts but the plan into the tire iron

10 
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,400
or supplied tool and start to loosen the
lug nuts just enough to make them

11 
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,460
easy to turn by hand if they're too
tight try using your foot for added

12 
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,110
leverage

13 
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,320
now place the Jag under your card in a
line it so that it lifts the car by the

14 
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,330
frame

15 
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,909
to raise the jack connect to handle he's
been inserted into the jack

16 
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:56,030
turning clockwise until it lifts the
vehicle one she praised the big also the

17 
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,140
flat tires off the ground remote

18 
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,590
love knots and put them in a safe place
such as the wheel cover so you don't

19 
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,110
lose one

20 
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:10,119
now remove the flat tire in laying on
the ground away from the car

21 
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:13,280
line up the spare and lived into place

22 
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,469
but the one that's back on and tied my
hands

23 
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:21,380
been tightened down each not with the
tire iron start with one lug nut the

24 
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,299
tighten the lug nut farthest away

25 
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:28,090
and so on until they are all tight to
finish up slowly lower the vehicle

26 
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,399
remove the jack and make sure the lug
nuts for tight one last time bad said

27 
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:36,640
I remember spares are designed for low
speed travel

28 
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,259
so it's important that you have your
original repaired or replaced as soon as
