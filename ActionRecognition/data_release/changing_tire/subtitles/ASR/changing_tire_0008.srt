1 
00:00:00,609 --> 00:00:04,319
first thing that we going to do is
actually loosen the nuts on the wheel

2 
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,870
so we going to loosen them diagonally
across and just enough so that we can

3 
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,179
have what we call them

4 
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:13,410
handlers once we've got that

5 
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,610
not flirt with then going to actually
jack up the comp we've already looked in

6 
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,100
the log book to find the correct

7 
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,310
checkpoint on the comp I was that the
Jack in under nato

8 
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,000
so that the jack almost close not quite
open and I'll

9 
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,780
and would slip them under the points
what we're going to do is slowly jack up

10 
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,180
the car into the jack is actually
touching

11 
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,800
that point in the Beagle words touching
and we slightly will start to jack up

12 
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,570
the car you'll notice the whole cow will
stop silly

13 
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,270
if we put the jack in the wrong spot you
might notice that the cops not lifting

14 
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:44,890
probably

15 
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,440
and also United that might make start
making some cracking noises

16 
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,160
once with jack the car up enough and
everyone always says how do I know it's

17 
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,590
enough

18 
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,020
jack it up until you've got a bad and
inch or two

19 
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,220
from the tire above the actual ground
all

20 
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,650
until the Jaquan go up any further now
what we going to do

21 
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:08,450
is loose in the not even more taking
them all off and we always stay put then

22 
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,900
into your pocket so you don't lose the
not if you lose one or two you can

23 
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,570
always take

24 
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,789
one of each other we'll to pull back
onto the spare

25 
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:20,519
so it but they're not to now pocket now
what we gonna do with

26 
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,530
actually carefully take the wheel of
sustaining not to lie

27 
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,859
staying fairly close to the con and we
going to lift the wheel

28 
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,659
all rolling the wheel onto the ground

29 
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:36,829
and we're going to grab the spare tire
so what we're going to do now stand very

30 
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:37,959
close to the

31 
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:41,519
the comp and I actually put my body
against the comp

32 
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,819
and we have to make sure that the actual
hold

33 
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:50,430
in the wheel lineup read the knots on
the comp so what we going to do is

34 
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,950
do that before we actually have to lift
the time I saw blind all the holdup

35 
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,480
we're going to lift it onto the whale
and

36 
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,499
sometimes it takes a little bit of a
jingle just to get them on

37 
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:05,109
I hold it with my Lake while I slowly
put the

38 
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:08,400
not back on diagonally across from each
other

39 
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,040
so that way you don't have just the top
ones on in the bottom of the wheel is

40 
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,019
parking out all the other way around

41 
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:17,439
like what they're not back on and I
tighten them by hand

42 
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,889
I can then law when the comp room if the
check out carefully

43 
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:25,170
and then I'm going to grab the range and
heightened

44 
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,299
the not top again until there's tired as
I can get them have a check around to

45 
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:31,549
make sure this not think that I've left
behind

46 
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:36,459
and then pack everything away back into
the big game

47 
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:39,459
so now we've got the spare tire on
couple things to point out

48 
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:44,249
it says temper use only spare tires are
designed to get you to a service centre

49 
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:46,810
not feed to keep driving for the next
few months on

50 
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,680
and if you see the sticky here at its
maximum 80 kilometers per hour

51 
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,409
you know Latics say that speed limit
with this time want you going to the

52 
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,139
time I sent

53 
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:59,200
they gonna putting it higher on for you
and then you're going to get will

54 
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,590
balance now will align

55 
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,639
that'll make sure that you can handle
the cop prickly especially in a breaking

56 
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,409
emergency

57 
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:08,760
all when you're turning a corner and
perfect for fuel economy

58 
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,049
so it's important that weiss et spare
tires on that you get back into a tie

59 
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:14,209
service center and get a correct i back

60 
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:16,709
go
