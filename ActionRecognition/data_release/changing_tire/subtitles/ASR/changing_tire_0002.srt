1 
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:04,259
ok

2 
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,410
getting but I was a real pain if you can
change itself it's like a whole lot more

3 
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,679
the lawn frustration once you've got the
cast slightly to the side of the road

4 
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,910
you'll need to find the spare wheel and
tools replace the plant

5 
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,820
in moscow has the spare wheel and
replacement tools located together

6 
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,640
under the floor in the back the
replacement tools consistent Jack

7 
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,750
to raise the comps so you can remove and
replace the wheel

8 
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,539
and arrange to take up the wheel nuts
that attach the wheel to the comps

9 
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,790
before you start to change will always
make sure the handbrake is on

10 
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,070
and the carries on a firm flat surface
to count move

11 
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,050
to begin with find the jacking point
closest to the wheel

12 
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,910
that you need to replace

13 
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,840
you can find it easily check the Owner's
Manual which usually located

14 
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,320
in the glove compartment if the car has
a hubcap use the tool provided to remove

15 
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,629
it

16 
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:58,020
loosen up the wheel much just a little
before you start checking the comp

17 
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,050
will not should be quite tight say only
to you some strength to remove them

18 
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,030
if you can't do it by hand try using it
would

19 
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,760
the next step is the checkup aka until a
flat tire he's weeklies the road

20 
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,550
ok

21 
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:20,550
up

22 
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:25,500
intake to loosen will much right of
remove the wheel

23 
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,030
up and replace it with this man up

24 
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,670
this might be the clearly the 1 seed
lined up the holes in the wheel

25 
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,400
with the corresponding screw holes on
the counter fixing the wheel nuts back

26 
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,040
on should be relatively easy

27 
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,030
up

28 
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,750
tighten the wheel much opposite each
other and to let them

29 
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,580
in lower the comps until the wheel makes
contact with the ground

30 
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,730
and tighten them firmly good

31 
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:56,520
when you done that love the cock
completely remove the jack

32 
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,140
and remember to put all the tools back
where they came from

33 
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,770
with the wheel with the fact I somewhere
handy so you can take it out to the

34 
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:04,840
garage door repair

35 
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,500
up

good

37 
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,440
finally his couple useful tips
personally always keep comin

38 
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,210

there's not much point in replacing one

39 
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,250
flight tie with another

40 
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,530
south from time to time check the
pressure in the spare tire
