these can be a little tricky but with
the added benefit

26 
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,260
trying to keep it as upright as possible
this will help the studs along with the

slightly firm up the wheel nuts

32 
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,140
they don't need to be completely
tightened at this stage but the wheel

33 
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,950
does need to be positioned correctly
lower the jack

34 
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,160
and legal the wheel nuts should then be
fully tightened

35 
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,400
using the wheel Bryce there's no need to
stand or jump on the wheel price:
