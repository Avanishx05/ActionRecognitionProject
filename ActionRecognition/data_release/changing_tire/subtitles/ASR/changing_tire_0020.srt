1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:07,290
scale

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,140
K

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,519
Hey

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,120
low

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,080
I in this installment we're going to be
covering is how to change a tire with

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,070
tools in your car

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,660
I took the initiative in called The Ohio
State Patrol on this just to find out

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,980
with the safest way to do this is

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,870
should you find yourself in a situation
where you have a blowout on the highway

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,239
most highly recommend a course of action
is to get off the highway completely

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,170
you don't want to be doing this on the
side of the road especially on a highway

12
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,090
where people are traveling at a high
rate of speed

13
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,680
if you absolutely have to pull off the
road what you want to do is get over as

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,020
far to the right as possible

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,780
first thing to do is to pressure hazard
switch that's usually located on the

16
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,790
dashboard has a red triangle

17
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,700
a in addition to that you can purchase
reflectors

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,090
or road flares that you could put out
just to alert other drivers that yes

19
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,129
there is somebody with a disabled
vehicle

20
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:09,180
and the don't get them gold hit me and
if you have AAA or

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,370
you know really big boy friend ur then
yeah by all means contact them and have

22
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,510
them do it for you if you don't feel
comfortable doing this

23
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,640
but should you be in a situation where
you absolutely have to do this

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,090
and I would go about this another thing
you want to consider before jacking up

25
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,190
the vehicle is putting the parking brake
on

26
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,310
normally spare tires are located in the
truck or

27
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,940
cases this car they're located the hatch
reason located under some kinda

28
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:39,940
access Peninsula good

29
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,970
this is normally where you would find
your spare time these are the tools

30
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,369
the you will need to work the jack and

31
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:58,550
to get the wheel of never attended this
tires flat

32
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:05,550
that now here's

33
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:12,260
something else to know and that is that
many times when you get your vehicle

34
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,090
serviced

35
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,980
check the air pressure not only in all
your tires but also in your spare tire

36
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,569
unfortunately there's rarely gets done
see may have a special request this

37
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:23,660
in some cases you may have to pay a
little more to have it done

38
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,670
cuz should you ever need it and its

39
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,370
doesn't have any area he really just
waste your time want the reasons why

40
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,850
doesn't get done all that often

41
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,790
is because in order to fill this up you
have to take it out of the car and

42
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,950
you can do your technician a favor by a

43
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,780
taking all the stuff I love your trunk I
i cant say how many times so he's asked

44
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,430
me to check the air their spare tire

45
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,849
and they've got you know a hundred
pounds topsoil

46
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:51,990
back a golf club stern close phone books
ak-47s

47
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,740
now that was an ar-15 sorry yeah all
kinds of things in your truck so you we

48
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,810
want to make sure that if you are having
somebody performers for you

49
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,000
to remove your personal items from the
truck ahead of time that would be very

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,030
helpful %uh times I'll say right at me
out so the tire

51
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,799
itself in this case it says inflict 260
PSI

52
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:13,049
love these instructions are also found
in your owner's manuals

53
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:17,890
and also listed warnings here on this
car the jack is kinda goofy place but

54
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,689
I'm gonna show you how to get it out
here

55
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:23,209
it's located in the back here or by
where the tire was

56
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:26,280
the way you can do is fight for the side
with the adjuster

57
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,379
this and then just twisted in this shit

58
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:33,780
bring it down you can take it out

59
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,629
now that you have the tire out of the
vehicle we need to do is you need to get

60
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:39,420
the damaged tire of the car

61
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,680
you look great show and

62
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,140
this little guy you'll need us to the
next thing you need to do is

63
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,129
loosen the lug nuts you don't wanna jack
the car up first thing you will always

64
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:54,939
love it

65
00:03:54,939 --> 00:04:01,939
if you get this we are headed to your
show you have a slick lol

66
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:06,120
so the first they were going to do is
we're going to try to

67
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,219
take a look into the scenes rudimentary
to say

68
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:14,120
in order to loosen things you turn them
counterclockwise in order to tighten

69
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,670
things you turn clockwise

70
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,370
these logos may be on a very very tight
see you may not be able to get

71
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,110
lose like this in fact

72
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,970
it's not very likely that you will so
there's 12 methods and gonna show you

73
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:33,970
the first message is to stay in a thats
method one

74
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,370
now you may not have the wat to

75
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,360
overcome this so I'm gonna show you
something that

76
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,720
if you're very careful about dealing you
can do this

77
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,889
but if you're in a pinch you can use the
way to the car

78
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,770
and the leverage and you jack know what
you wanna do

79
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,360
is position the jack key such a way

80
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,620
its gonna come in contact with the
bottom of the lug wrench

81
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:06,620
like this don't try to make sure that
this fits in this little not rehear

82
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,200
what that's gonna do in effect

83
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,600
as use the way to the car overcome

84
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,990
how title lug nuts now if you wonder
what this little hokey thing is for

85
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:26,370
show this again towards the end

86
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,870
keep an eye here to make sure this
doesn't come flying off it make it

87
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,470
violent

88
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:34,630
but that is that is an alternative
method using no strength

89
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,270
but gravity to listen to Loughner

90
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,140
you may have to try this more than once
because you're gonna need to get it in

91
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,770
just the right position in order for
this to work gonna

92
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:50,770
loosen the rest these in the
conventional footpath

93
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,690
now that you have all the lugnuts lose
its time to jack the car up

94
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,000
now there's a couple points on cars
mater motorcars

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,030
usually seen have these points and some
vehicles actually had a responding to

96
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:05,710
these areas

97
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,280
and there's also diagrams in some cases
that show you

98
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,580
where the jack points are for the core
in this case

99
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,180
see this reinforced area right here ray
here

100
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,340
is another area what you want to do

101
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:27,080
his position at Jack under this area so
that

102
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,730
this not fits rate under

103
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,510
this so it kinda cradles itself in there

104
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:41,510
this is called the scissor jack the

105
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,560
usually a good way to get these officers
to give a little

106
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,430
will hit but sometimes wheels get stuck
on herbs and sometimes you have to

107
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,520
kick them pretty hard if you're unable
to get the wheel of a car

108
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,070
which does happen sometimes particular
with aluminum wheels

109
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,010
what you can do is you can put the
lugnuts back on

110
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,590
but don't tighten them all the way we
them a little bit loose

111
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,540
drive the car for a few feet or whatever
you have to do and

112
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,980
a lot of times the way to the car will
break them loose the scissor jacks me

113
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,240
very precarious wanna be very careful

114
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,720
not to knock the car of the jack because
if you do it will hurt you

115
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,790
pretty bad and you don't want a bad
situation to get worse

116
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,520
but the next step is to put the wheel of
on

117
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:41,520
do

118
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,230
the okay now you have

119
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,540
a the new tire on you want to

120
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,910
let the way the vehicle of the jack see
want to bring the Jack downing

121
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,640
this

122
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,550
the

123
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,420
T

124
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,820
okay now that you've got the vehicle
back down on the ground it solidly wanna

125
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,570
tighten the lug nuts one final time sign
in a clockwise direction

126
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:18,570
you don't need the time this thing so
much that you never gonna be able to get

127
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:25,330
the wheel off again

128
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:29,430
just make them snug you got enough
leverage with with the leverage that it

129
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,190
should be okay

130
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,909
you know that you are have any spare
tire mount it and take the other tire

131
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:41,909
putting your truck is probably most
logical place to put it hope this helps

132
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,710
you should you be stranded with a flat
tire at some time just the bullet points

133
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,810
get off the highway if it's at all
possible

134
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,080
dropped off the highway listen let us be
four you jack or

135
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,460
tight looked at after you let the cargo
using the jack to

136
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,540
possibly lose located me too don't drive
around for an extended period of time

137
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,780
when the spares they're not designed to
be tires they're designed to get you

138
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:09,030
some place to where you can either get
your tire repaired or replaced by I hope

139
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,790
that this

140
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,990
that information was helpful to you if
you have any questions or comments

00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,110
we've been down here or you can visit me
at Air

this is gonna be fun

143
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,620
you might just learn something K
