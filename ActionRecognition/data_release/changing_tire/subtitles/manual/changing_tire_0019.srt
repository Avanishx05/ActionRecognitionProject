5
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:08,250
We'll now loosen it with the wheel down and
give it a couple good rams.

6
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,660
Make sure its full of air, worst thing you
want to do is put on a flat spare.

7
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,400
Then you pull out this tire, careful this can be
quite heavy.

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,270
We have our spare tire and our jack we have set our
reflective warning signal out.

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,100
We've also chocked the wheel on the
opposite side of the flat tire.

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,250
So we are ready to start changing it. The first
thing we will do, is jack the vehicle up.

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,390
You have to loosen the jack a little bit
in order to get the handle off.

12
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:39,390
This particular model has the lug wrench
built right in. Before we jack though

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,410
we would want to loosen the lug nuts
because once is jacked up it's going to

14
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,320
be very difficult to get those lug nuts
off.

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,940
This particular model has a hubcap which
we will just loosen those up.

16
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,040
Doesn't take much because they are made out of
plastic.

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:57,210
Set the hubcap out of the way.

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,750
Now you have access to the lugnuts. Loosen
the lug nuts.

19
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,750
Position yourself firmly, pressing

20
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,540
counterclockwise loosen the lug nuts.

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,049
Not too loose, just enough the crack them.

22
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,720
If they are a little stubborn, position
yourself over

23
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,159
using your knee or your foot you can
gain leverage.

24
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,409
Now we are ready to jack it up. This is a common
scissors jack

25
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:29,500
the screws move in and out allowing the mechanism to move up and down and lift

26
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,110
your car.

27
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,979
So as you turn it to the right it'll go
up, as you loosen it

28
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:40,030
the jack will collapse allowing the car to
come down. Now we'll position the Jack,

29
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,950
you want to be sure to get the Jack under a
good part of the frame.

30
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,119
Your owners manual is a good place to find
where to properly jack the vehicle.

31
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,700
You can raise it up by hand

32
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:59,700
till it contacts the frame and is in a good position.
We use the jack handle to raise the

33
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,209
vehicle.

34
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:04,349
Insert the end of the jack handle into
the jack,

35
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:07,610
using it as leverage it'll help make the
car go up easier.

36
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,140
Remember turn it clockwise to go up and
counterclockwise to go down.

37
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:16,840
Carefully jack the car up. Never stick
your hands or legs

38
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,680
under the vehicle as the car can fall and cause damage.

39
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,879
Jacking can take a while so be patient
cautious as you jack.

40
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:32,769
Okay now that the car's jacked up now
take the lug nuts loose.

41
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:36,879
Remember we already pre loosened them when the
car was on the ground making it easy.

42
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,180
Notice they will come right off now. Trying to do
that while the car was jacked up would

43
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,230
be very difficult.

44
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,540
Remember to keep your lug nuts in close
hand you don't want them rolling away in

45
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,129
the grass because it will be hard to find and that's what holds your tire on.

46
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:56,550
Again we're turning them
counterclockwise to get them loose

47
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:03,440
or to the left. We'll remove the

48
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,840
flat tire set it over here out of the way.

49
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,440
Now if there's heavy traffic in the area you wouldn't
want to leave it in the street you might

50
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,860
want to put it to the rear of the car.

51
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,440
Grab the spare tire put it in position.

52
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,900
You are gonna Center the spare tire on the
wheel studs,

53
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,450
that's where the lug nuts go. So go ahead and do that.

54
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,930
Lining it up. You will see it lines up pretty
easy.

55
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,260
Then install your lug nuts. Again,

56
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,750
clockwise is tight, counterclockwise is
loose.

57
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,980
So we'll tighten them up by hand

58
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,989
as far as they'll go.

59
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:47,430
Once the tire is centered,

60
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,680
lug nuts are hand tight, take the lug
wrench,

61
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,010
again turning it clockwise

62
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,019
tighten the lug nuts till they are firm.

63
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:01,069
Not too tight because remember your car is up
on a jack. We wouldn't want it falling off with

64
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:02,370
too much leverage or force.

65
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,790

66
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:13,790
Insert the jack handle back into the jack

67
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,800
turning it counterclockwise again we're
gonna lower the vehicle.

68
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,419
Again this'll take some time but going
down is a lot easier than going up.

69
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:26,639
If it seems to go down easy you can just
do it like this by doing it straight

70
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,900
instead having an angle.

71
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,590
But if it's too tough you can angle it
and get the leverage that you need to

72
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,410
lower the jack

73
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:37,110
or to raise the jack. Turn the Jack low
enough

74
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,740
you can do it by hand now that it doesn't
have contact with the frame.

75
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,810
And we can remove it. Now that the tires are
on the ground we'll go ahead and give them that

76
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,800
final tight.

77
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,150
We're gonna start down here then move
to the top one then back down

78
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:54,250
over and baki again, a little star pattern,
making sure we have equal torque

79
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:58,830
on the wheel studs.

80
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,380
Okay well we have our spare tire on, it's aired up,

81
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,229
we're ready to go. Couple of things to
remember though is you want to put everything back in

82
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:05,870
the trunk.
