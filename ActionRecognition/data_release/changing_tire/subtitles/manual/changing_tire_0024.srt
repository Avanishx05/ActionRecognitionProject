5
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,930
The first thing you need to do is make sure you change the tire in the
safest location available to you.

6
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,099
Changing a tire on the road shoulder

7
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:13,679
can be dangerous. Take two minutes to
assess the potential dangers around you

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,320
before you start. 

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,460
Once you have parked the car make sure the
handbrake is on

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,660
and put the car into park for an automatic
and into first gear for manual.

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,170
Next, get out the spare tire,

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,180
Jack and wheel brace from the boot.

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,270
Place the jack on a secure flat surface.

14
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,350
Position it so it is directly

15
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,600
under one of the jacking points of the
car.

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,320
Your car manual will show you where they are.
But simply

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,229
they're usually behind the front wheels
or just in front of the back wheels.

18
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:56,340
Now just before you jack the wheel up
off the ground you want to loosen off

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,890
the nuts otehrwise depending on the type of car,
the wheel can just

20
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,560
free spin when you tryin to turn the nuts. so
you take the wheel brace

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,310
and you put it on to the nut and
have the wheel brace

22
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,619
roughly horizontal to the ground and
only with your arms straight

23
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:15,610
pushing downwards, this will be
enough for you to loosen off the nuts.

24
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:22,610


25
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:28,840
As a tip to remember which way you turn
to loosen the nuts, left is loose and

26
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,170
right is tight.

27
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,689
Use the jack to lift the car. You'll find
you won't have to lift it too high.

28
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:41,619
Remember never put any part of your body

29
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:45,049
under the vehicle that is being jacked
up.

30
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:48,280
Now remove the wheel nuts completely
using the wheel brace.

31
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,729
You can now fit the spare wheel

32
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:55,209
tighten the wheel nuts and then lower
the jack.

33
00:01:55,209 --> 00:02:01,099
Once you're finished up, don't forget to take
your damaged tire to a shop to be repaired.
