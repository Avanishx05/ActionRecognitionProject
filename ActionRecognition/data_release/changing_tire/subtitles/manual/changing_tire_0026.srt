20
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,179
Tires come in different sizes. Your spare maybe a
little donut size

21
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:11,560
or it could be a full size tire like
this. One of the things to remember

22
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,289
is if you have a flat tire on the front
you're gonna want to take

23
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:19,259
the rear tire and put it up front if
you are front wheel drive

24
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:24,020
or vice versa if it's the other way
around where you have a rear wheel drive

25
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:24,899
vehicle.

26
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:29,470
So let's get started. Most of your
vehicles today

27
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,750
actually have the tools to actually
raise your vehicle

28
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,840
located underneath the hood or under the
seat or maybe in the trunk. Our vehicle

29
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,030
jack and jack tools are located

30
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,219
behind the rear seat here. You know it's
a good idea

31
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,380
to check your owner's manual and locate
your tools before you

32
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,149
are in a situation where you need to
find them quick. Let's just go ahead and

33
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:56,219
lift up our seat.

34
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,350
our Jack is right here and looks like our
jacking tools are right here.

35
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:08,350


36
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:15,870
So let's just go ahead and take a look
at what we have here.

37
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,310
These are chocks we're gonna place those
in the front tires.

38
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,190
Here's our jack. This is actually our lug nut

39
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,989
wrench. We're gonna take those off with that

40
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:33,239
and these are going to be to get

41
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:38,380
to our jack and to our spare so let's just go
ahead and get prepared for this.

42
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,019
what we want to do is we wanna raise our tire


43
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:47,269
our axle up just a little bit and now
what we're gonna do is we're gonna go back

44
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:50,310
and loosen our lug nuts.

45
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,489
so let's just go ahead this first nut is
a cap on this vehicle.

46
00:01:54,489 --> 00:02:00,530
so we're just gonna loosen those up.
removing the cap will

47
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:06,030
expose our lug nuts. we wanna just loosen
them up a little bit.

48
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:13,030
what we want to do is we want to push down.

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,970
don't try to pull up. use your weight.

50
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,330
let's just go ahead

51
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,810
access our spare

52
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:32,810
tire.

53
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:41,400
we're gonna lower it.

54
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,830


55
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:52,830
so we're just gonna remove our lug nuts
now. rock your tire.

56
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Pull it off.

57
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:15,440
Our spare.

58
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,720


59
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,240
now we can lower our vehicle

60
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,290
and continue tightening our nuts. now that
we have our tire back on the ground

61
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,590
we wanna make sure that our lug nuts

62
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:38,590
are tight. we're gonna tighten them in a
staggered motion.
