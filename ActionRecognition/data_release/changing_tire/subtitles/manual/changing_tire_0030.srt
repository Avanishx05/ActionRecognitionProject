5
00:00:00,059 --> 00:00:04,029
Pull over where it's safe to do so, apply the hand brake

6
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:08,930
and put the vehicle into first gear. Grab
your vehicle jacking equipment from 

7
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,699
under the mats in the boot and jack up the car
slightly from under the jacking points.

8
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:18,540
If you have any wheel chocks place them
under the opposite wheel

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:25,540
from the wheel affected.

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,850
If you have a locking wheel nut, be sure
to have this in hand.

11
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,480
place the locking wheel nut on the locking wheel nut

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,160
bolt.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,750
Should you be using the wrench, be sure to
select the right direction.

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,750
Consult your vehicle manual to correct
all settings

15
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,460
if you're using the torque wrench. Remove each bolt

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:54,460
and keep safe nearby.

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,880
Jack up the car slightly higher to free
the wheel. Remove the wheel.

18
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,640


19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,020


20
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:25,020
Get the spare tire from out of the boot.

21
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,240
Place the spare tire in position

22
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,240
and hand tighten each wheel bolt. Select the
opposite direction you were using earlier

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:52,259
if using the wrench. You may need to lower
your jacking device

24
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:59,259
ever so slightly to stop the wheel spinning.

25
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,989
Using the diagram displayed on this
video on screen

26
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:22,450
tighten each bolt in ascending order. Both
five bolt and four bolt wheels are

27
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,190
displayed.

28
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,450
This keeps the torque tightening equal for
all

29
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:33,450
of the bolts. Once you're done, remove your jacking
device

30
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:54,709
removed from under your vehicle along with
the wheel chock. Place both back in your boot.
