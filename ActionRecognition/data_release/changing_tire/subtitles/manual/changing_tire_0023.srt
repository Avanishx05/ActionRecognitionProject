5
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:06,960
In most cars, you'll find everything you need to 
put on a spare tire, in your trunk. Just lift up this back panel

6
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,009
you'll see we've got spare tire

7
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:13,009
this is a donut. Other cars  have

8
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:16,620
full-size spare that's really nice but
this'll do for the time being until you

9
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:16,989
can

10
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:20,399
get a brand new tire. Also got a jack

11
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:27,129
This device is used for actually cranking
the jack

12
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:31,160
the and a tire iron and so we'll get these out

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,670
and then get started on removing the tire
which currently isn't flat but just for

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,410
the sake of

15
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,940
showing you how to do it we're gonna remove it and
we're gonna install the spare.

16
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,749
We've got all our tools out here. We've got the tire iron.

17
00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:47,010
What I wanna do is before using

18
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,200
the jack at all, I wanna loosen up these lug nuts

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,730
because once the wheel is off the
ground you're not gonna get

20
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:02,730
the same amount of leverage.

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:11,500
Just loose enough.

22
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,650
So now that they are all

23
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,340
loose

24
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,100
I'm gonna grab this jack and see this

25
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,240
right here with the hole? You crank that by
hand so

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,509
get to the point where there's little
groove down here

27
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,390
for the jackpoint. So I've put a glove on
because

28
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,330
you can get pretty dirty and some of these parts
cna be sharp and you can cut your fingers possibly.

29
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,880
See these two grooves right there?

30
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,259
That's indicating where you can put this
jack.

31
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:52,459
And you wanna put this metal piece in between
this part right here.

32
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:55,540
okay so just

33
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:02,540
tighten it up by hand or turn it by hand.

34
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,790
Make sure it's nice and straight and once it's
touching the bottom

35
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,489
of the car here at the jackpoint it
starts to get tight,

36
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,340
then you wanna get that tool so just
hook it in there.

37
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,000
And so,

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
it's a little bit off but then you kind of just do one of these things.

39
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,710
And then you go until that tire lifts off the
ground it doesn't need to be

40
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,480
more than a couple inches off the ground.
You just want enough space

41
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:45,480
enough clearance to get the tire off. So
tire's lifting up.

42
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,470
You can use the jack anywhere unless
you're on a very very steep incline

43
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,110
because then it's going to be very very
difficult to keep it steady but

44
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,760
these are built to be used anywhere. Okay
so as you can see

45
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,970
got the tire off the ground got enough clear
that I cna put my whole hand under it.

46
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:11,970
So now I'm gonna loosen up these lug nuts by
hand.

47
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:23,340
Make sure they don't roll away.

48
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,629
Sometimes you have to angle the wheel a

49
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:37,010
certain way to loosen up the lug nut.

50
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,099


51
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:43,879
Alright let's just take the wheel off, very simple
 set it aside.

52
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:47,959
And now we can go get

53
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:52,890
the spare tire out of the back and I'll show you how to do that.
Alright so we got the 

54
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:57,560
donut back on the here. For security you wanna
make sure that they're

55
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,660
not floating around loose in the back of your
car. 

56
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,120


57
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,820


58
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,310


59
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,229
One thing that's important to check

60
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:17,710
is that the tire pressure, recommended tire
pressure on the spare.

61
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:21,060
Right here it says sixty pounds maximum
pressure.

62
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,630
You cna go a little bit less than that but the idea
for using

63
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,620
a donut is not to use it permanently.
It is just a quick fix until you're able to

64
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,539
get a brand new tire.

65
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:35,940
Another thing to note that you're not supposed to
go over 65 miles per hour

66
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,910
on a donut. Alright so, pretty
straightforward

67
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,419
just just lift it up by two hands, if you need to get
leverage

68
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:47,460
put your knee down or whatever just do
that. Make sure it's all the way on.

69
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,800
Use the same exact lug nuts

70
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,879
that you took off off your full size tire then tighten them by
hand.

71
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,900
There's no rule

72
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,080
about how to put lug nuts on but in most
cases

73
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,590
if you have four or five, general idea is just kinda skip
every other one.

74
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:13,289
I think it just promotes an even tightening
all around.

75
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:19,319
So that's nice and snug.
Just notice how much smaller that is

76
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:19,849
than the

77
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:23,500
full size tire.	What I'm gonna do

78
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,120
is give it a quick little tightening

79
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,169
with my hand not like

80
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:37,169
too crazy yet. Okay

81
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:42,470
and now we go back to our jack here hook
that in but reverse the motion

82
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,030
until we get that tire touching the
ground again.

83
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:50,990
And now we give that one last tightening and make
sure it's secure and then you can hit the

84
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:51,420
road

85
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,620
with a tire that actually has air in it.

86
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,600
Things are really handy

87
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:07,490
when you have this tool you can get
this motion going. 

88
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,090
Alright so see this is loose now which
means

89
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,410
the tire is supporting the car.

90
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:21,410
Bring that out. Get my tire iron.

91
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:30,979


92
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:34,960


93
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,900


94
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,680
So great we have our spare tire
installed and

95
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,180
I made a point of using the things that
come with the car that go underneath the

96
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,150
panel in your trunk.

97
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:51,490
Because you're not gonna have access to
all the tools you have in a toolbox at

98
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:56,280
home. The last step is to take your full
size tire which should be flat otherwise

99
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,750
there's really no need to change it and all
tools came with car

100
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,460
put them all back where you took everything out,
close that off and you're ready to roll.
