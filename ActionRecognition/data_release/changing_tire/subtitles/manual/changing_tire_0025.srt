2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,080
First stop the car on a hard flat surface.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,230
You're gonna set your emergency brake,

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:12,680
put the shifter into park for an automatic
or reverse for manual transmission.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,980
You're gonna stop your engine and turn on your emergency

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:22,980
flashers. We're gonna begin by identifying some 
tools and components that you're gonna be using to perform this task.

7
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:36,690


8
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:48,739
Location ofyour spare tire and jack may vary from model to model. Please 
refer to your owner's manual to find out where the location is on your model.

9
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:55,739
You're gonna access your luggage compartment and remove 
any loose items or articles that may be in your way.

10
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,990
Remove your Jack cover to access your jack.

11
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,830
Once you have unhooked the jack

12
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:26,250
then slide the jack out of the vehicle.

13
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:33,250
Next remove the large plastic screw in the center of the luggage compartment.

14
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:41,780
And then remove your spare tire cover.

15
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,780
Next you are going to remove your hold down bolt.

16
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:18,820
Now you are able to remove your spare tire.
The tools that you are going to want to be using

17
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,400
are your lug nut wrench and your tire jack handle.
They are located on the bottom side of your spare tire cover.
You are going to want to remove these to be able to use them with the jack.

18
00:02:53,850 --> 00:03:00,850	
We are going to begin by removing your wheel hub cap using the
flat ended end on the lug wrench.

19
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:03,909


20
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:10,909
You are then going to loose each of the lug nuts about one time.

21
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,770
You are now ready to position the jack under the car. 

22
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,970
You are going to put the notch of the jack on the pinch rail moulding

23
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:41,780
which is located under your car up here. There will be indentations 
on your pich rail mouldings where to locate the notch of the jack..

24
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,030
This is the view of the pich rail mouldings.
Notice the arrow

25
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,519
and the indentations on your pinch rail mouldings. This is where you
place

26
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,190
the notch of the Jack when you are raising it.
Now you are gonna take your jack

27
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,550
and by hand start screwing the jack up

28
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:02,550
until it comes in contact with your pich rail moulding.

29
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:15,030
Now you can insert the jack handle 

30
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:20,800
and begine raising the vehicle by twisting
the jack handle in a clockwise motion.

31
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:27,800
You are gonna raise it until the tires up off the ground.

32
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:35,300
Now you can remove the remainders of your lug nuts and your flat tire.

33
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,540
Using a rag or paper towels, clean the surface, remove any dirt or debris,

34
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,640
then you can install your 

35
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:07,640
spare tire.

36
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,720
Install all your lug nuts and tighten them by hand.

37
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:54,900
And now lower the vehicle back on to the ground.

38
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,990
Using your lug nut wrench, tighten each lug nut two to three times

39
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:19,990
moving in a star pattern while you're doing it.

40
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:40,860
Use your body weight with your lug nut wrench to ensure proper torque.

41
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:57,370
We can now finish lowering the vehicle and reinstalling your jack and tools
and your flat tire back into your luggage compartment. 

42
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,970
Once you lay your large trash bag out in your luggage compartment,

43
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:06,970
you can reinstall your tools and your flat tire back into your luggage compartment.
