3
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:05,220
In most vehicles if you need to locate your

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,689
tire they'll usually be located in the trunk unless you're

5
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:11,900
driving a truck or an SUV, they'll usually

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,920
be located up under the car next to the fuel tank.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,770
So in this car here, we have the Jack

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,780
on this side, we have our tools then 

9
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,250
we have our actual tirelocated here.

10
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,810
So I'm gonna pull all this stuff out

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:45,810
and show you guys how to do this. Alright so we got our spare tire here, we've got our jack stand and we also got our tool to remove the 
lug nuts. On this particular

12
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:49,120
car we also have a lug nut key to deter

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,690
people from stealing the rims off your car.

14
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,470
First thing we're gonna do here is look up under the
car and we're gonna look

15
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,770
for the folded piece of metal and that's gonna
be our actual jack point

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,810
and that's where you actually want to have the jack centered. 


17
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:11,810


18
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:19,230


19
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,010


20
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,230
Now we're just going to raise the jack up a little bit.

21
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:33,000


22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000


23
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:46,509
Alright so once we get the jack in position, we don't actually wanna 
jack up the car yet.

24
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:48,290


25
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,610
We're going to break the torque on the lug nuts

26
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:56,049


27
00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:01,340
You gotta remember, right to tight and left to loose.

28
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,080


29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:11,080


30
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,040
Now that all of our lug nuts are nice and loose now
they're not finger loose but they're loose 

31
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,450
enough that we can deal with it, doesn't have to deal with

32
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:32,450
the torque. Start to jack the car up now.

33
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:54,360


34
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,360


35
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:05,360


36
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:11,599


37
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:18,599


38
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,209
Alright now once the tire's actually
left the ground

39
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:42,209
we can use the key to take off the lug nuts rest of the way.

40
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,740


41
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:59,740


42
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,660


43
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:14,140


44
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,590


45
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:21,050
Now we got our lug nuts off, we just want to 

46
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:25,050
remove the tire.

47
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,419
At this point we put our flat tire in the back of the car 

48
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:35,419
and we put on our donut.

49
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:37,979
Now with most

50
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:42,460
most donuts that come with new cars nowadays

51
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,550
they're good for

52
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,219
about 40 miles before we actually need to get the tire changed.

53
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:53,289
it's important to get it changed as soon as possible.

54
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:58,240
So now what we wanna do is put our lug nuts back on.

55
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,220


56
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:09,220


57
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,129


58
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:23,129


59
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,870
Don't worry about tightening them down all the way yet.

60
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:40,870
Put them on snug so they don't go anywhere.

61
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,409


62
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:52,610


63
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:59,610


64
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:03,970
So now we got them all snug on there we can now lower the
car back down

65
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:10,970


66
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,250


67
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:26,250


68
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,190


69
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:35,740
Once we got car back down on we can now

70
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,220
tighten up all these lug nuts.

71
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:46,220
Now how you want to tighten these, you wanna do it in a star pattern.

72
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,090
Start at the top here then you skip one.
