5
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:05,539
You'll need a car jack, a lug wrench, wheel chocks, a spare tire

6
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:10,890
tire pressure gauge road flares or
reflective triangles.

7
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,510
turn off the engine and engage the
emergency brake.

8
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,290
put your hazard lights on and place road
flares or reflective triangles on the

9
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:19,930
ground

10
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:24,390
to make yourself visible to oncoming
traffic. use your tire gauge to check

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,780
if your spare tire has enough

12
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:30,960
air pressure. if it doesn't try to get
another tire or call roadside assistance.

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,180
place a wheel chock or something heavy
under the center of each tire

14
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,120
before you jack the car up off the
ground. remove the hubcap

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,900
if necessary. then use the lug wrench to
loosen the lug nuts.

16
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,560
most vehicles have a marker in the
bottom panel indicating where

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,119
your car jack belongs. once it is placed in the proper
spot

18
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,190
use your jack to lift your vehicle until the
flat tire clears the ground. remove the

19
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,330
loosened lug nuts.

20
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,890
once the lug nuts are off pull the flat
tire off the wheelbase.

21
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,670
store all the lug nuts in a secure pile
so you don't lose the before mounting the new

22
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,170
tire.

23
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,330
line up the wheel holes with the bolts on
the wheelbase.

24
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,020
slide the tire as far back on the wheel
base as it can go

25
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,390
and place your lug nuts back on. Tighten
each nut until there's resistance.

26
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:22,070
use the car jack to lower your vehicle
until the tire is back on the ground.

27
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:27,040
then remove the jack. use your lug wrench
to rotate each nut clockwise

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,840
until they're completely tight. now put
away your tools.
