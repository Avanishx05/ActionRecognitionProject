1 
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,170
You can change the wheel yourself.
Everything you need is in the bot:

2 
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:13,020
spare wheel, jack and wheel brace. There's
also a socket to fit a locking bolts on

3 
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:13,919
other wheels.

4 
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,180
Start by slacking in each bolt by half
a turn.

5 
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,059
Locate the jack at the mounting point

6 
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:25,460
as shown in the owners manual and lift the
car so the wheel

7 
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:31,059
is clear of the ground. Remove the bolts and
then the wheel.

8 
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:34,190
Most of the spares nowadays are space
savers.

9 
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,220
They must only be used to get to the
nearest car repair a

10 
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:42,340
and a maximum speed limit applies. Place
the spare wheel in position

11 
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,579
and hand tighten the bolts. Moderately
tight each bolt using the wheel brace.

12 
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,780
Lower the car and then remove the jack.

13 
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,570
Now fully tighten the bolts in a cross
sequence as shown. And there you have it back

14 
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,219
on the road!
