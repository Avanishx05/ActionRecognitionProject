25
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,190
Another thing you want to consider before jacking up
the vehicle is putting the parking brake
on.

26
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,310
Normally spare tires are located in the
trunk or

27
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,940
in the case of this car they're located in the hatch.
They are usually located under some kind of

28
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:39,940
access.

29
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,970
This is normally where you would find
your spare tire. These are the tools

30
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,369
the you will need to work the jack and

31
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:58,550
to get the wheel off. And this
tire is flat.

32
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:05,550
Now here's

33
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:12,260
something else to know and that is that
many times when you get your vehicle

34
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,090
serviced

35
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,980
check the air pressure not only in all
your tires but also in your spare tire.

36
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,569
Unfortunately this rarely gets done
so may have to request this

37
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:23,660
and in some cases you may have to pay a
little more to have it done.

38
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,670
Because should you ever need it and it

39
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,370
doesn't have any air then you're really just
wasting your time. One of the reasons why

40
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,850
it doesn't get done all that often

41
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,790
is because in order to fill this up you
have to take it out of the car and

42
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,950
you can do your technician a favor by a

43
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,780
taking all the stuff out of your trunk. I
cant tell you how many times somebody has asked

44
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,430
me to check the air in their spare tire

45
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,849
and they've got you know a hundred
pounds of topsoil,

46
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:51,990
bag a golf clubs, dirty clothes, phone books,
ak-47s.

47
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,740
No that was an ar-15, sorry. You have all
kinds of things in your trunk so you

48
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,810
want to make sure that if you are having
somebody perform this for you

49
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,000
to remove your personal items from the
trunk ahead of time, that would be very

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,030
helpful. A lot of times it'll say right at the
outside of the tire

51
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,799
itself, in this case it says inflict 260
PSI.

52
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:13,049
A lot of these instructions are also found
in your owner's manuals

53
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:17,890
and also a list of warnings here. On this
car the jack is kind of in a goofy place but

54
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,689
I'm gonna show you how to get it out
of here.

55
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:23,209
It's located in the back here or by
where the tire was.

56
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:26,280
Now what you can do is look for the side
with the adjuster

57
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,379
like this and then just twist it and this should

58
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:33,780
bring it down you can take it out.

59
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,629
Now that you have the tire out of the
vehicle what you need to do is you need to get

60
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:39,420
the damaged tire off of the car.

61
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,680
Get your lug wrench out and

62
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,140
this little guy, you'll need this too. The
next thing you need to do is

63
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,129
loosen the lug nuts. You don't wanna jack
the car up first thing. You want to

64
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:54,939
loosen the lug nuts. 

65
00:03:54,939 --> 00:04:01,939
If you get this wheel up ahead of time, let me
show you what will happen.

66
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:06,120
So the first thing we're going to do is
we're going to try to

67
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,219
take the lug nuts off. Now this seems rudimentary
to say.

68
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:14,120
In order to loosen things you turn them
counterclockwise. In order to tighten

69
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,670
things you turn clockwise.

70
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,370
These lug nuts may be on very very tight
so you may not be able to get

71
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,110
these loose. Like this. In fact

72
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,970
it's not very likely that you will. So
there's one or two methods that I'm gonna show you.

73
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:33,970
The first method is to stand on. Thats
method one.

74
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,370
Now you may not have the weight to

75
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,360
overcome this so I'm gonna show you
something that

76
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,720
if you're very careful about doing you
can do this.

77
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,889
But if you're in a pinch you can use the
weight of the car

78
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,770
on the lug wrench and your jack. Now what
you wanna do

79
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,360
is position the jack in such a way

80
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,620
its gonna come in contact with the
bottom of the lug wrench

81
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:06,620
like this. Try to make sure that
this fits in this little notch right here.

82
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,200
What that's gonna do in effect

83
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,600
is use the weight of the car to overcome

84
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,990
how tight the lug nut is. Now if you wonder
what this little hookey thing is for.

85
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:26,370
See how this is getting towards the end?

86
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,870
Keep an eye here to make sure this
doesn't come flying off it may get

87
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,470
violent.

88
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:34,630
But that is that is an alternative
method using no strength

89
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,270
but gravity to loosen the lug nut. 

90
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,140
You may have to try this more than once
because you're gonna need to get it in

91
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,770
just the right position in order for
this to work. You're gonna

92
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:50,770
loosen the rest of these in the
conventional foot method.

93
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,690
Now that you have all the lugnuts loose
its time to jack the car up.

94
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,000
Now there's a couple of points on cars.
Modern cars

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,030
usually seem to have these points and some
vehicles actually have arrows pointing to

96
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:05,710
these areas

97
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,280
and there's also diagrams in some cases
that show you

98
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,580
where the jack points are for the car.
In this case

99
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,180
see this reinforced area right here right
here

100
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,340
is another area. What you want to do

101
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:27,080
is position the Jack under this area so
that

102
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,730
this notch fits right under

103
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,510
this so it kinda cradles itself in there.

104
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:41,510
This is called the scissor jack. 

105
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,560
Usually a good way to get these off
to give them a little

106
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,430
hit but sometimes wheels get stuck
on hubs and sometimes you have to

107
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,520
kick them pretty hard. If you're unable
to get the wheel off a car

108
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,070
which does happen sometimes particularly
with aluminum wheels.

109
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,010
What you can do is you can put the
lugnuts back on

110
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,590
but don't tighten them all the way. Let
them a little bit loose

111
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,540
drive the car for a few feet or whatever
you have to do and

112
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,980
a lot of times the weight of the car will
break them loose. These scissor jacks can be

113
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,240
very precarious. You wanna be very careful

114
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,720
not to knock the car of the jack because
if you do it will hurt you

115
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,790
pretty bad and you don't want a bad
situation to get worse.

116
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,520
The next step is to put the wheel 
on.

117
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:41,520


118
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,230
Okay now that you have

119
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,540
the new tire on you want to

120
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,910
let the weight of the vehicle off the jack so you
want to bring the Jack down.

121
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,640


122
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,550


123
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,420


124
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,820
Okay now that you've got the vehicle
back down on the ground it's solid, you wanna

125
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,570
tighten the lug nuts one final time. Tighten
in a clockwise direction.

126
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:18,570
You don't need to tighten these thing so
much that you are never gonna be able to get

127
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:25,330
the wheel off again.

128
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:29,430
Just make them snug you've got enough
leverage with with the lug wrench that it

129
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,190
should be okay.

130
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,909
Now that you have the spare
tire mounted it and take the other tire

131
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:41,909
and putting it in your trunk is probably the most
logical place to put it.
