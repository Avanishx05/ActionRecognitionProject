1 
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,550
First make sure your emergency brake is
engaged.

2 
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,119
This will prevent the vehicle from
rolling.

3 
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,310
Next locate your spare and jack.

4 
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:21,310
This can usually be found in the trunk. 

5 
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:39,550
Lay all your tools so they're easy to
reach.

6 
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,230
Locate the pinch weld where the body and
the frame meet.

7 
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:50,230
Slight the jack underneath and raise it
until it touches the weld.

8 
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,000
Loosen the lug nuts just a bit then jack
up the car.

9 
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,560


10 
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,880
Make sure the tire has completely lifted off
the ground.

11 
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,460
Then remove the lug nuts

12 
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:17,460
and the flat tire. 

13 
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,570
Put on the spare and replace the
lugnuts.

14 
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:36,570

15 
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:49,740
Lower the car until the tire makes
contact with the ground.  

16 
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,530
Tighten the nuts in a star pattern. This ensures
that the tire goes on straight.

17 
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,530


18 
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,550
Drop the car down the rest of the way
and you're good to go.
