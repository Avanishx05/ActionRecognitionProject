1 
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,850
Once you've got your car in a safe place
off the road make sure the handbrake is firmly 
applied

2 
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:11,440
and the car is on a flat surface so it doesn't
roll away.

3 
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,999
Have a look in the boot of the car, you
should find a spare tire and the tools
you need to use.

4 
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:19,100


5 
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,120
A few cars like this one have a cradle under 
the back of the car.

6 
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,089
The instructions following the cradle to
release the tire

7 
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:29,129
can be found in your owner's manual.
The tools you need

8 
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:33,300
are jack to raise the car off the ground and
a wrench that you need to remove the wheel

9 
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:33,719
nuts

10 
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,069
that are tightly screwed onto the tire.
Most cars

11 
00:00:37,069 --> 00:00:40,289
have alloy wheels but some models have
plastic wheel trims

12 
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:44,429
which you'll need to pop off to see the exposed 
wheel nuts.

13 
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:47,500
Before you jack the car up, use the wrench
to loosen the wheel nuts 

14 
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:53,939
just slightly. They're going to be
really stiff so use your foot if you need to.

15 
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:58,750
A lot of cars have one nut that's different 
from the rest which requires a special key
to remove.

16 
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,090
This  "taught" people being able to
take the alloy wheel

17 
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,700
off the car without the locking wheel nut
key that came with your car.

18 
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,359
The key fullfills into the wheel wrench. To jack the
car up you need to find the jacking point

19 
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,939
which can be found underneath the car
near the tyre that need replacing.

20 
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,420
Position the jack underneath the jacking point 
and then raise the car until the tyre is

21 
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,149
about 10 centimetres clear of the
ground. If you don't raise it high enough

22 
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:28,350
then you may struggle to get the new
spare tyre on. And it's not safe to raise it

23 
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,799
while the wheel is off.

24 
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,259
Once the car is safely raised take the wheel nuts
off completelely, 

25 
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:42,259
remove the tyre and replace it with the spare.

26 
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:52,230
Line the new tire up with the corresponding
screw holes on the car.

27 
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:57,830
Once lined up screw the wheel nuts back
into place.

28 
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:02,610
You need your wrench again here to tighten the
wheel nuts started enough of each others

29 
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,190
to make sure that they're not unbalanced. Don't
try to charge them fully

30 
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,500
jsut yet though.

31 
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:14,170
Lower the car back to the ground surface
with you jack tool until the tyre touches

32 
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:14,690
the ground.

33 
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:19,250
Once it is safely on the ground tighten the wheel
nuts firmly.

34 
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,620
If your car wear trims pop the trims back on making sure 
that secure all the way around.

35 
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,409
You are now ready to finish lower the car 
to

36 
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:28,450
the ground completely.

37 
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,989
Remove the jack, put your tools away and
get back onto the road.
