1 
00:00:00,759 --> 00:00:05,729
Right, on this particular car the first job
we have to do is to remove these plastic caps

2 
00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:11,120
that go over the actual nuts. Yes, they do
look like the actual nuts themselves but they're

3 
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,870
not. Right, they're off! Don't jack your
car up without loosening the nuts because

4 
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,280
when you try and undo them, the wheel will
just turn round and round. It sounds obvious.

5 
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,760
I've done it.

6 
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,640
This was in the tool kit. It's the adapter
key for the one locking wheel nut which we

7 
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,560
need to release first so let's make sure that's
in position. Now I could have used the standard

8 
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,940
wheel brace, this lightweight one that came
with the car, this is a standard issue. You

9 
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,060
need to have had a decent

10 
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,860
breakfast if you're going to use one of these!
I'm a reasonably robust lad but what I'm going

11 
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,110
to do is rely instead on what I think is safer
which is one of these after market wheel

12 
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,520
braces. You can get two hands on it and we
can exert some real leverage. So let's get

13 
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,360
this one off first. 

14 
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,360
There we are! Right, so I'm going 
to loosen these off but
I'm not going to take them off completely

15 
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:16,150
because I do not want this wheel to come off
when I don't want it to. There would normally

16 
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:23,050
be almost always there are instructions in
various languages on here as to how to use

17 
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:27,830
this jack and where it goes, most importantly
where it goes. If you try and raise the whole

18 
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:32,220
weight of this vehicle by putting this in
the wrong place, it can puncture the body

19 
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,040
work and you really don't want to do that
and worse still, it can be a danger to you,

20 
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,870
the person who is changing the wheel.

21 
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:44,230
So I've had a look and it tells me that there
is on the sill here, there's a depression

22 
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:51,230
where that goes so there it is. So I've got
that in nice and tight, just finger tight

23 
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:59,629
there. Right! 

25
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,430
One thing as well, if you do 
have other people with you for godness sake

24 
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,769
make them get out of the car or if they are
in the car, if they are children and they

25 
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:14,340
are in the car make sure they stay in the
car. The last thing you want when you're jacking

26 
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:21,289
up a car is people opening and closing doors
unnecessarily and getting in and out of the

27 
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:22,189
vehicle.

28 
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:28,430
Right, let's get this wheel off. Just put
these to one side there is nothing worse

29 
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:33,159
than getting half way through this job and
finding out that you have lost one of the

30 
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:37,860
wheel bolts!

31 
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,770
Right, let's stick the space saver on. There
was quite a bit of resistance to space saver

32 
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,270
tyres when they first came out a few years
ago but as well as having the advantage of

33 
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:56,229
liberating space inside the car and reducing
weight which reduces your fuel consumption

34 
00:02:56,229 --> 00:03:00,430
and improves your performance, they are also
much easier to handle. Wheels and tyres have

35 
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:06,139
got bigger and bigger and bigger and heavier
and so the space saver has all kinds of advantage

36 
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:13,009
but for goodness sake, look at it. It's perfectly
safe but don't leave it on your car for a

37 
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:18,099
few weeks. I don't want to see you in the
car park at the supermarket loading up the

38 
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:22,460
car with one of these things on. Once you
have got one of these on, the only place you

39 
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,360
need to be going is the tyre specialist or
your dealershop.

40 
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,589
Just tighten these up now. I don't think
I'll put the plastic caps back on because

41 
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:34,360
I'm only going to be leaving it on for as
long as it takes me to get to a dealer now

42 
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:42,330
aren't I? So you've seen me put them on finger
tight at first and that's a good way of starting

43 
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:48,039
them off so that you're going into the existing
thread; you're not as they say cross threading

44 
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:51,999
the hub. You don't want to force these bolts
in to start with. However, once you've got

45 
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:56,050
them all finger tight it is good practice
to get hold of the tyre at the top here if

46 
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:56,589
it's this space

47 
00:03:56,589 --> 00:04:05,270
saver like this and just give them a twist
in turn with the wheel brace so that the wheel

48 
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:09,800
isn't moving around at all. The wheel is nice
and secure, I can let the jack down and then

49 
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,929
I'll properly tighten those five bolts and
make sure the wheel is on right.

50 
00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:27,159
Right, let's take the jack out. Now that the
wheel is firmly on the ground, tighten these

51 
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:32,490
nuts; as much pressure as you can apply on
one of these four way wheel braces, that's

52 
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,639
probably about as tight as it needs to be.
When you're tightening these up by the way,

53 
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:42,360
try and tighten opposite to opposite instead
of going round the clock to make sure that

54 
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,099
it's squarely on the hub.

55 
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:49,279
Right, they're all tightened; the wheel is
secure; it's pumped up and ready for the road

56 
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,619
again.
