1 
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:04,259
Ok,

2 
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,410
getting a flat tire is a real pain but if you can
change it yourself it can save a lot more

3 
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,679
delay and frustration. Once you've got the
cast slightly aside of the road,

4 
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,910
you'll need to find the spare wheel and
tools replace to replace the flat.

5 
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,820
In most cars the spare wheel and
replacement tools are located together

6 
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,640
under the floor in the back. The
replacement tools consist of the jack

7 
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,750
to raise the car so you can remove and
replace the wheel

8 
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,539
and a range to take off the wheel nuts
that attach the wheel to the car.

9 
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,790
Before you start to change the wheel, always
make sure the handbrake is on

10 
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,070
and the car rise on a firm flat surface
so it can't move.

11 
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,050
To begin with find the jacking point
closest to the wheel

12 
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,910
that you need to replace.

13 
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,840
If you can't find it easily, check the owner's
Manual which usually located

14 
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,320
in the glove compartment. If the car has
a hubcap use the tool provided to remove

15 
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,629
it.

16 
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:58,020
Loosen up the wheel nut just a little
before you start jacking the car.

17 
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,050
The wheel nut should be quite tight so you'll need
to use some strength to remove them.

18 
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,030
If you can't do it by hand try using your 
foot.

19 
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,760
The next step is to jack up the car until the flat tire 
easily clears the road.

20 
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,550


21 
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:20,550


22 
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:25,500
And take the loosen wheel nut right off,
remove the wheel,

23 
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,030
and replace it with the spare.

24 
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,670
This might be a bit tricky but once we have 
aligned up the holes in the wheel

25 
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,400
with the corresponding screw holes on
the car, fixing the wheel nuts back

26 
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,040
on should be relatively easy.

27 
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,030


28 
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,750
Tighten the wheel nuts opposite to each
other until they are firm.

29 
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,580
Then lower the car until the wheel makes
contact with the ground.

30 
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,730
Then tighten them firmly. 

31 
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:56,520
When you've done that lower the car
completely. Remove the jack

32 
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,140
and remember to put all the tools back
where they came from.

33 
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,770
Put the wheel with the flat tire somewhere
handy so you can take it out to the

34 
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:04,840
garage door repair.
