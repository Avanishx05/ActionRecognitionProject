1 
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:05,630
Switch on your hazard lights. Make sure the
handbrakes is on and the car is either 
in gear or for an automatic

2 
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:10,270
in park. If you have a safety triangle
place it "wheel" before your vehicle to

3 
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,820
alert oncoming motorists.

4 
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,080
Remove the jack,

5 
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,200
jack handle, wheel brace and spare tyre
from the car

6 
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,660
and place them on the ground. This is to avoid
any unnecessary movement of the car

7 
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,020
once its hoisted. Finally before lifting
the car

8 
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,190
loosen the wheel nuts slightly but don't
remove them

9 
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,830
entirely. Different jacks have different
instructions and every car

10 
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:40,260
has a specified jacking point. Be certain
to familiarize yourself

11 
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,460
with days before hoisting the vehicle.
Instructions

12 
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,040
must be followed exactly and nearby.
Place yourself

13 
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,360
under a vehicle that is hoisted by a
jack. Jack the car up slightly to secure

14 
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:52,900
the jack

15 
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,590
under the car but not to raise the wheel
off the ground. Then

16 
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,989
once you're sure of that, continue jacking
the car up

17 
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:03,480
until the tire is approximately five to
ten centimeters

18 
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,680
off the ground. Remove all the wheel nuts
from the studs

19 
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,470
and store them in a handy place. Remove
the flat tire.

20 
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,500
Rolled it out of the way and lie it down on
its side

21 
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,350
so it doesn't roll away. Roll the
replacement tyre 

22 
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,720
up to the vehicle. the tyre now needs to
be lined up with the wheel studs

23 
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,739
these can be a little tricky but with
a bit of effort

24 
00:01:24,739 --> 00:01:29,070
it should slip on without too much
hassle. When placing the replacement

25 
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:29,820
wheel on

26 
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,260
try to keep it as upright as possible.
This will help the studs aligned with the

27 
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,459
holes in the wheel rim.

28 
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:39,769
Once the wheels is located,  
replace the wheel nut

29 
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:43,910
onto the top stud as this will help to
keep the other studs located

30 
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,670
on the rim. All wheel nuts can now be
secured

31 
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,360
finger tight. Using the wheel brace,
slightly firm up the wheel nuts.

32 
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,140
They don't need to be completely
tightened at this stage but the wheel

33 
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,950
does need to be positioned correctly.
Lower the jack

34 
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,160
and vehicle. The wheel nuts should then be
fully tightened

35 
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,400
using the wheel brac. There's no need to
stand or jump on the wheel brace  :

36 
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,550
the correct torque can be achieved using arm
strength.

37 
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,150
Replace the wheel cover if necessary.
Collect the flat tire,

38 
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,140
wheel brace, jack and safety triangle and
store them securely.

39 
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,270
you can get back on the ride but don't
leave it  too long before you get your damaged

40 
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,730
tire repaired or replaced.
