16
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,930
the essential tools you will need

17
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:05,110
to change a spare tire on your car and
the tools you

18
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,350
always and I mean always have to have in
your car are

19
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,600
a emergency signal or a triangle

20
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,290
you have to have a tire ranch you have to
have a car jack

21
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:21,080
and of course you have to have a spare
tire.

22
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,940
the first thing you do when you get a
flat tire

23
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,580
is get yourself off the road. the
most important thing

24
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,150
in experiencing

25
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,510
a car problem is car safety. so
safety is first.

26
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,720
the first thing you have to do is to get
your car off the road.

27
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,880
so if you're on a highway a freeway

28
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,560
or a remote country road like we
are here

29
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,890
always get your car off the road in a
safe place so other

30
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,110
people in traffic can go by you or stop

31
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,500
and help you. you do that by 

32
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,399
stopping your car turning off the engine
pulling the handbrake

33
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,640
turning on the
emergency lights like that

34
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,160
and using the emergency signals or
the triangle as I have told you.

35
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,210
you put the triangle in a distance

36
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,160
from the car that is safe so that
the other people that are coming

37
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,330
your way in your lane will be able to
stop

38
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,750
in a safe distance and not cause a car
accident because you

39
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,200
have a flat tire. so remember make
yourself

40
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,830
visible and safety is first.

41
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,720
so we have stopped the car

42
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,980
turned on the emergency lights put the
emergency signals at a safe

43
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,590
distance.

44
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,650
now we are safe on the road.

45
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,570
so now we're gonna change the tire. this of
course as you see is not a flat

46
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,060
tire but since this is the simulation
you will get

47
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,680
a pretty good idea what you have to do
to change a tire.

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,720
the first thing we do is take off the
rim cap.

49
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,730
it usually goes by hand

50
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,390
if it doesn't use a screwdriver. we put
the rim cap

51
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,530
aside and here are the tire screws.

52
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,340
the second thing we do is take the
car wrench.

53
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,480
so take the car wrench put it on

54
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,480
the tire screw and

55
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,220
apply pressure. in this case 
we have a tire wrench which has many

56
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:17,730
levers.

57
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,400
in case you have one lever which goes
like this you can use one hand

58
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,130
in this case we're using two hands.

59
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,530


60
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,370


61
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,870
in case you have

62
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,390
a tire screw which you can't turn loose 

63
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,000
with the strength of your hands do 
not

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,250
despair. many men
and women have problem with this because

65
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,269
the tire screws

66
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:51,799
in this part here have corrosion which
does not let them

67
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:54,920
to be loosened by the strength
of your hands.

68
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,070
so you put be tire wrench here on
the screw.

69
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,310
if you can't do it with the
strength

70
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,610
of your hands use the strength
of your body.

71
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,940
the the weight of your body. put a
hand here

72
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,209
put a leg here and simply jump on it.

73
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:17,850

74
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,620
so this can actually really help you
when it the tire screws

75
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,210
do not want to budge.

76
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,860
okay now we've loosened the tire screws.

77
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,880
now we take the carjack. always
remember

78
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,600
to pull your handbrake. 
you do not want your car to go

79
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,690
right or left when it is on the carjack.

80
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,150
put the car jack in the place on the
floor

81
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,950
where the car jack is supposed to go.
every car has

82
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,590
an appropriate place where the car jack
should be put. and we turn.

83
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,980


84
00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:01,430
always try to put the jack

85
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,820
in a straight position and be sure that the

86
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,840
foot of the car jack is on a firm
surface. so

87
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,210
in this condition this is a country road
which has gravel

88
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:16,050
and it does not matter because it is a
firm surface. so don't put it in mud

89
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,830
or oil or in anything that will
cause the car to slide off the jack.

90
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:23,319


91
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:26,630
we lever it up.

92
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:33,630


93
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,880
as you can see

94
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,229
the tire is up.

95
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:45,199
so the car is up.

96
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,919
the tire is free. it is in the air. you
take

97
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:54,979
the tire wrench and take the screws off.

98
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:58,159
you can take them off by hand you can
take him off with the tire wrench

99
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:03,019
whatever you like. hold it a bit.

100
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:07,059
don't be shy to get yourself

101
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:13,149
a bit dirty. take off the tire. take off
the spare

102
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:16,360
and put it on.

103
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,839
these holes should match

104
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:24,089
the holes on the car wheel.

105
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:30,110
put the screws on as far as they go

106
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:37,110
by hand.

107
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:45,500
we take the tire wrench and

108
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,110
we tighten the tire so much as it goes

109
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:55,400
with small pressure.

110
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,790


111
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:00,360
most people make a big mistake by
tightening

112
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,530
the

113
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,650
tire on the car while the jack

114
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:09,590
is up. what you get by doing
something like that the car goes right

115
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,720
or left or far

116
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,300
falls out the jack cause you
many problems

117
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,810
you know and perhaps can badly injure
you.

118
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,980
so tighten it just so the tire stays. the
tire

119
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,880
is on the vehicle. now

120
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,880
of course we lever it down.

121
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,490
make

122
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,770
enough space for the car jack to go out.

123
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,360


124
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,960
and we proceed to

125
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,889
tighten the spare tire.

126
00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:01,360
so we go like this and like this

127
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,590
this and this.

128
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,930
we apply some pressure. always remember
when tightening the screws go

129
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,970
diagonally. do not go circling
around.

130
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,520
go like an X.

131
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,620
you apply as much
pressure as you can

132
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,819
with your hands so tighten them up.

133
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:29,919

134
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,470
always tighten them up good because you
don't want

135
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:38,140
to risk your wheel from falling off
the car. you can put

136
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,940
the rim cap back on or you don't have
to.
