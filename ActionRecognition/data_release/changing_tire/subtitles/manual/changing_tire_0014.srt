15
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,079
The spare wheel and the toolkit is generally underneath the

16
00:00:03,079 --> 00:00:06,260
boot floor like this is the spare wheel

17
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,320
and in this car the tools are inside

18
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,809
this little compartment here.

19
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:17,090
Just take that out, here we've got the jack

20
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,199
and

21
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:26,119
the wheel brace and a little tool to help us take
the

22
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:29,510
wheel trims off. The wheel is normally
held down by

23
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,210
a clamp of some sort. You have to take this
off to take the wheel out.

24
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,360
The wheel is quite heavy so just careful

25
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:43,360
as you take it out.

26
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,350
Before you go through all the trouble of
taking off the wheel and putting on the new

27
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,509
one just make sure

28
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:53,340
that there's plenty of air in in the one you putting on.
If you don't have a gauge

29
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,030
you can usually check by bouncing the wheel.
Give it a bit of a

30
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,659
push and see does it feel fairly
solid. If you have a gauge

31
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:07,649
you can just check the pressure quickly.
On this car which has steel wheels we

32
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:09,689
have to take the plastic wheel trims off
here

33
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:14,140
to get access to the wheel nuts. On
cars with aluminium wheels

34
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,399
you would probably use a tool like this
which takes the

35
00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:22,899
pulls the center cap off the wheel so we can get
to the wheel nuts. So let's take the

36
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:26,920
wheel trim off. Just prize it off

37
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,349
gently as you can with

38
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:34,130
a screwdriver there and it just pops off. Now you can
see the wheel

39
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,230
and the wheel nuts. this is the factory
supplied wheel brace.

40
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,370
As you can see it's not very long and it
doesn't allow you to get a great deal

41
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,959
of leverage on to the wheel nuts. We'll give it a
try and see how we get on.

42
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:49,730
Using all

43
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,989
of my weight there that isn't budging an
inch. So

44
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:58,560
there are two options. You can either use
an aftermarket item like this

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,639
which is extendable and I always use

46
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:05,660
something like this to be honest coz these really are not great. The
other option is

47
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,230
and this isn't great for my health and
safety point of view I'm sure is to

48
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:09,940
stand on it

49
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,410
and literally bounce.

50
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,230
You might have noticed we started 
undoing the wheel nuts before we've

51
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,100
jacked the car up. The reason for this is
that it's much easier to just

52
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,269
undo the nuts one half a turn

53
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,639
before the car is up in the air and it's
safer as well because you're putting

54
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,170
less

55
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,670
pressure on to the jack and you're
moving the car around less

56
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,959
when it's still on the ground. I'm
actually going to change from the

57
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,359
factory wrench to the extendable one
just to make my life easier

58
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:43,560
to undo the rest of the wheel nuts. What I
forgot to mention

59
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,030
earlier on is that it's left to loosen

60
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,700
right to tighten. We're just doing

61
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,810
each wheel nut one half a turn and then

62
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,170
we can jack the car up. Don't loosen
these

63
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,470
more than half a turn because we
don't want the wheel to be

64
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:08,319
loose on the car before we jack it up. Now
we're going to jack the car up.

65
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,290
It's really important you need to find
the jacking points on the car.

66
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,530
These will be in your hadn book. But usually there is one they are on

67
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,709
both sides of the car. One just behind the
front wheel and one just in front

68
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,590
of the rear wheel. It's really important

69
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,879
that you jack the car at the jacking points otherwise

70
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,010
the jack might go straight through the floor
which is not what you want.

71
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,510
Another thing we're using the

72
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,740
the factory supplied Jack here. I don't
like them at all, I don't think 

73
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,419
they are great and I'd much rather use something
like this.

74
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:47,320
oaks and two ton trolley Jack. They have a much wider
footprint, it is much more stable.

75
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,030
I'll show you what I mean when this car is
jacked up.

76
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,030
We've just got the front wheel off the ground
there

77
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,060
but we need to go a little bit higher
because this tire is flat

78
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,650
and the new one isn't flat so we need to
allow for that

79
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,669
bit of space there. Show you what I mean. There's quite a bit a
movement

80
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:10,969
there with the standard Jack. This is
a much more stable job

81
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:15,020
and something I much rather use

82
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,320
one of these than one of these guys. Something I should
have just mentioned before I jacked the car

83
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,810
up.

84
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,930
You must have the car in gear and handbrake on.
It's really very important to do that.

85
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,440
Very unsafe if you don't. Now ready to take the
wheel nuts off.

86
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,740
We've loosened them half a turn already

87
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,080
so they should come off pretty easily
and

88
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,659
take out the studs like that. We don't
want to be

89
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:42,180
swinging off the wheel wrench while the
car is

90
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,150
up in the air on the jack because as you
saw there it's a

91
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,520
little bit unstable with the the factory
supplied

92
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,110
Jack. I always try to take off the

93
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,589
lower wheel nuts first and

94
00:04:56,589 --> 00:05:01,589
just try to leave one on a at the top the last one.
Just seems to make it easier so

95
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:04,589
that wheel so you can just have it out
like that. So

96
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:11,149
just hold it in place. That's the last one

97
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:17,669
and the wheel can come off. We've got the wheel
off,

98
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:21,140
we've got the spare here this tire's not
the best but it'll get us out of trouble and

99
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,760
get us home 

100
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,950
until we can get to the garage to change it.
Now

101
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,479
I'll show you two tricks to getting this
wheel back on

102
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,539
safely and as easily as possible. Look
where your

103
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:35,700
stud holes are and look at the position
of them.

104
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,959
You need to get the wheel holes

105
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,500
in that same position. The second
thing

106
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,169
is this is very very heavy probably
weighs at least 20 kilos

107
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:51,000
so lifting this into position is
half the key to getting it on

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,360
quickly and easily so roll the wheel in 

109
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,959
into place and just shimmy around

110
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:01,649
until you have the stud holes roughly in
the same position

111
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:05,209
as the stud holes on the brake
disc on the hub.

112
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:09,209
Get into a crouching position like
this and then

113
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:12,630
put your elbows on to your thighs and you
literally

114
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,860
just use your thighs to support

115
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,250
the weight of the wheel it's not the most
flattering or glamorous of positions

116
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,080
but it saves your back and it makes the job
much easier.

117
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,149
Now you can just rotate the wheel a
fraction

118
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:34,890
until the stud holes and the wheel
lineup.

119
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:39,029
And literally just wiggle the studs in
one by one.

120
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:44,360
Just do them half a turn get them all in

121
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,459
and that's it. Now do two

122
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:51,950
studs opposite of each other finger
tight.

123
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:58,950


124
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,099
There you go, do them as tight as you can by hand

125
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:15,099
and then tighten the rest of them up.

126
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:19,570
Doing them finger tight on first just ensures
that you have the wheel

127
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,370
on flat and true you don't want to have to

128
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,500
tightened one stud or nut up before all
the others and

129
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,769
you know the wheel could be wonky. 
And we just tighten them

130
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:36,860
half a tuirn with our wrench.

131
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,550
Just nip them up like that and then
we can lower the car back down on the

132
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,209
jack

133
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:45,610
and we will tighten them up properly once the
car and wheel is back on the ground.

134
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,370
Now we can lower the jack again it's
left to loosen

135
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,260
right to tighten or have to lower in
this case and

136
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:58,000
right to raise.

137
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,269


138
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:05,220
Now we can tighten up the wheel nuts. To tighten
the wheel nuts I'm gonna use the

139
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,760
extended bar again don't need to be

140
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,360
swinging off this, jumping up and down on
it so

141
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,480
just around in a circle,

142
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:24,740
just nip them up.

143
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,480
And that is it. All we need to do now is
put the plastic hub cap back on.
