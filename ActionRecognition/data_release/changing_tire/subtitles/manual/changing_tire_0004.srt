1 
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,920
For automatic you want them in park. Next

2 
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,010
take off the hub cap if your 
car has one. Then use your wrench 
to partially loosen the lug nuts.

3 
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:13,120
If you are not sure how to remove the
hub cap, just check your owner's manual.

4 
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,240
Also check to see if your car has
plastic covers over the lug nuts like 

5 
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:17,750
this one.

6 
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,369
If so, then take them off first.
Your log nut wrench probably won't fit
over them.

7 
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:25,390
And make sure you put them somewhere
safe so you don't lose any of them.

8 
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,430
Now to take the lug nuts off, go in a
a star pattern loosening one of the lug nut

9  
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,860
a half turn and then loosening the one 
opposite ot it. Walk your way accross the 
tire

10 
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,469
until all the lug nuts are unscrewed
a half turn.

11 
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:40,409
Before you jack up the car,

12 
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:44,600
put a heavy object like a brick in front of the
wheel diagonally opposite to the flat tire

13 
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,140 
to prevent the car from slipping. Here is
where the jack comes in.

14 
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,280
Put it under the car's frame  near the wheel
with the flat. There is a thin lip that run
along

15 
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,079
the side of the car,

16 
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,969
that's usually where the jack is. It can
be different though so just check

17 
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:00,959
your owner's manual for the safest place
to put your jack under the car.

18 
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:04,619
Remember it is possible for the car
to slip of its jack,

19 
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,890
so never get underneath the car that
is only support by a jack.

20 
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,109
Okay so now you've got the 
jack in place. Now enter the
handle

21 
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:15,770
and turn it clockwise to
lift the jack up. If it lowers 
the car a wrong

22 
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,430
turn, try turning the handle the other
way. Make sure you raise the jack high

23 
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,209
enough to replace your flat tire.

24 
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:25,680
The new tire will be fully there so
you will need more room anything. 

25 
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,860
Remember those lug nuts you 
loosen earlier. Now you can
take them off

26 
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,579
completely.

27 
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:33,790
Once the lug nuts are off, you can pull 
off the flat tire.

28 
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,290
To make sure you put the new tire on the right
way, look at the air valve,

29 
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,709
it should be facing out. To replace the
lug nut, go into the same order

30 
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:42,540
you loosen them. 

31 
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,819
Tight one nut a few turns and then do
one opposite until each lug nut 
is partially tighten. 

32 
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:51,160
Then go back accross your star pattern
to tighten them completely.

33 
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,799
To lower the jack

34 
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,599
turn the handle slowly counterclockwise
until the tire just makes contact with the

35 
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,049
ground.

36 
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:02,870
And watch out for you feet as 
you lower the jack.

37 
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,060
A flat foot is even worst than 
a flat tire.

38 
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,909
Make sure each lug nut is completely
tighten before you remove the jack.

39 
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:16,019
Don't forget to put your jack and
the object with the flat tire back
in your before you drive off.
