00:00:01,259 --> 00:00:02,039
Fixing a flat tire

2 
00:00:02,039 --> 00:00:05,930
is easy. If you're on the road
pull your car over to a safe flat
spot.

3 
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:10,349
Next, put your vehicle into park or 1st
gear

4 
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,609
and apply the emergency brake. Now locate
your spare tire.

5 
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:18,140
On most of today's SUV's and trucks
the spare is

6 
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,670
under the vehicle. Retrieve it following
the steps in your owner's manual.

7 
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,519
It's a good idea to check the spare's
pressure before you go any further.

8 
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,330
If your spare's pressure is good continue
on with changing your flat

9 
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,570
by popping off the cover to access the
lug nuts with a flat into the tire iron

10 
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,400
or supplied tool. Start to loosen the
lug nuts just enough to make them

11 
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,460
easy to turn by hand. If they're too
tight try using your foot for added

12 
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,110
leverage.

13 
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,320
Now place the jack under your car in a
line it so that it lifts the car by the

14 
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,330
frame.

15 
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,909
To raise the jack connect the handle piece
and insert it into the jack

16 
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:56,030
turning clockwise until it lifts the
vehicle. Once you've raised the vehicle so that the

17 
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,140
flat tire is off the ground, remove

18 
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,590
the log nuts and put them in a safe place
such as the wheel cover so you don't

19 
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,110
lose one.

20 
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:10,119
Now remove the flat tire and lay it on
the ground away from the car.

21 
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:13,280
Line up the spare and ligt it to place.

22 
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,469
Put the log nuts back on and tied  them 
by hand.

23 
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:21,380
Then tighten down each nut with the
tire iron. Start with one lug nut then

24 
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,299
tighten the lug nut farthest away.

25 
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:28,090
And so on until they are all tight. To
finish up, slowly lower the vehicle

26 
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,399
remove the jack and make sure the lug
nuts are tight one last time. That's it!
