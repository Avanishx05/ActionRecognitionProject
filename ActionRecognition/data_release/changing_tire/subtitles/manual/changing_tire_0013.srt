1 
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,280
If you have roadside flares or a reflective
triangle, use them to warn other drivers that

2 
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,399
you're working on your vehicle. Consider keeping
a canned tire sealant in your emergency kit.

3 
00:00:14,399 --> 00:00:19,280
If your tire has only been slightly compromised,
the sealant may patch it long enough to get

4 
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,060
you to the service station. Step 2. Find heavy
objects ( like bricks or rocks ) to block

5 
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,500
the wheels. Place them in front of and behind
the tire that's diagonally across from the

6 
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,430
one that went flat. If you have plenty of
rocks, block both wheels on the opposite axle.

7 
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,049
If you have a digital camera (or a cell phone
with a built-in camera) snap a picture before

8 
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:44,310
you start disassembling everything. That way,
you'll have a ready reference guide of how

9 
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:50,049
things should look when they go back together.
Step 3. Lay out your spare tire, jack, and

10 
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:55,650
lug wrench. Many tires feature a locking lug
nut to guard against theft. To remove, use

11 
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:01,829
the special key tool the car's manual will
specify where it's located. Step 4. Most lug

12 
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,700
nuts follow the righty-tighty/lefty-loosey
rule. Attach the lug wrench to a nut, and

13 
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:12,470
turn the wrench counterclockwise. Repeat with
each lug nut until all the nuts are loosened.

14 
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,759
Step 5. Refer to the owner's manual for the
best spot to place the jack typically along

15 
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:22,399
the frame, very close to the flat tire. Jack
the car up until the wheel is off the ground.

16 
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:27,459
Never get under the car when it's on a jack.
Since it's fairly unstable in this position,

17 
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:32,959
keep other people away until the car is safely
on the ground. Step 6. Remove the lug nuts

18 
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,519
one at a time, and keep them together in a
spot where they won't roll away or disappear.

19 
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:43,099
Then remove the flat. Step 7. Mount the spare
tire onto the wheel lugs. You may need to

20 
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:48,049
jack the car up some more to slip on the spare
tire. Check the tire pressure on your spare

21 
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:53,799
regularly. That way, it won't be flat when
you need it. Step 8. Replace one lug nut at

22 
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:58,909
a time. Begin tightening each by hand, then
continue with the lug wrench. Lower your car

23 
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:04,010
to the ground, and finish tightening the lugs
in opposite pairs, to ensure uniform pressure.

24 
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:08,829
Once you're done, replace the hubcap. Step
9. Remove the objects blocking the wheels,

25 
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:14,699
and place the tools and the flat tire in your
trunk. Step 10. Your wheel is ready, but you

26 
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:19,249
won't be able to drive as quickly on a spare.
