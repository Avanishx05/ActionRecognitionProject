1 
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,450
Step 1: when changing a tire it is
important to pick a location with a

2 
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,890
solid level ground to ensure the
stability of the vehicle when being

3 
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:08,790
jacked up.

4 
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,400
In our situation we are on concrete so
we will not have to worry about that.

5 
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,250
However if you are in an emergency
situation

6 
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,020
like your tire blew on the highway call
over to the right hand shoulder of the

7 
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,890
road and turn your hazard lights on.

8 
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:27,330
Make sure that your vehicle remains
on the concrete portion.

9 
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,539
If a car is jacked up on the sand or
dirt portion of the shoulder

10 
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,800
the jack will sink which can cause
damage to the vehicle as well as

11 
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,380
threatening your safety.

12 
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,680
If you drive an automatic put the
vehicle in park

13 
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,899
and apply the emergency brake. If you
drive a standard vehicle

14 
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:48,000
place the car in first gear and apply
the emergency brake.

15 
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,020
Step 2: locate the necessary
tools needed to change your tire on your
vehicle.

16 
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,280
Some vehicle require

17 
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,000
a locking wheel nut key. Before traveling
ensure that you are aware of the location

18 
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,879
location of this tool.

19 
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,899
Without it you will not be able to
remove the lock on the lug nuts.

20 
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,310
The most common storage area for
these materials is the trunk of the

21 
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,700
vehicle.

22 
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,369
Lift the carpet and proceed to remove the
spare tire

23 
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:17,310
and the tire items. Most vehicles will have the
jack assembly

24 
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,270
underneath the carpet as well. But in the
case of this vehicle

25 
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:28,270
they are stored in a compartment left hand side.

26 
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,510
Step 3: start with the jack by placing
it under the frame

27 
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:41,530
closed to the tire that need to be 
changed. It is important to ensure is
contacting the frame

28 
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,690
directly to avoid damage to the side
scured. The majority of modern vehicles

29 
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,970
have a designated area

30 
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,150
near each wheel. The designated area is usually

31 
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,520
a pinch weld. In this case it is an indet. If you drive
a truck or older vehicle

32 
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,150
there may not be a pinch weld available.
If this is the case jack the vehicle up

33 
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,770
from the frame. Step 4: 

34 
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,500
Proceed to raise the jack onto the pinch
weld or frame until the car is firmly

35 
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,250
supported without

36 
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,750
actually being raised into the air. At this
time

37 
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,900
make sure that the jack is firmly
planted onto the ground so that it will

38 
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,360
not shift. Step 5:

39 
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,270
locate the lug nuts on your vehicle. If
your vehicle has hub cap or a center cap

40 
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,620
you may have to pry them off depending
on the design. From here

41 
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,580
lug nut should be loosened but not
completely removed. As you can see

42 
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,700
the lug nut on the far right is a
locking lug nut. This is why you will need

43 
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,900
the locking key

44 
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,260
enabling to remove it. From here lug nut
should be loosened but not completely

45 
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,130
removed.

46 
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,970
Breaking their resistance of the
lug nuts may take quite a bit of force

47 
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:51,970
depending on how tight they are.

48 
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:59,250


49 
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,530
Step 6:

50 
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,940
Fully raise the car of the ground by
pumping or in this case

51 
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,110
cranking the jack. The amount of clearance
that you want between your tire and the

52 
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,650
ground

53 
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:15,650
should be enough so that you can freely remove
the tire.

54 
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,750
Step 7:

55 
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,930
Remove the lug nuts completely of the hub
of the vehicle.

56 
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:39,930
This may take some time, be patient.

57 
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,690
A quick tip is to ensure that you
remember where you put

58 
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,050
the lug nuts. There's nothing worse than
losing the lugnuts

59 
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:18,420
when you try to put the tire back on.

60 
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,000
Step 8: Remove the tire there may be
some resistance when trying to take off

61 
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,710
the tire.

62 
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,550
This is often the case when it is winter
and water freezes between the wheel and

63 
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,010
the hub.

64 
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,910
Don't be afraid to give it a good ludge
or kick.

65 
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,570
step 9: Take the spare tire and place it
on to the hub

66 
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:41,900
matching the holes on the wheel to the
wheels nut.

67 
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,150
Step 10 : place the lugs onto the stud of
your tire.  

68 
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,950
Proceed to hand tighten the lug nuts
until they are snugged. Again

69 
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:52,190
this may take some time, be patient.

70 
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:59,190


71 
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:13,980


72 
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:29,289


73 
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:32,259
Step 11 : tighten the lug nut securely.

74 
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:36,659
For this five lug assembly the procedure
in tightening the lug nuts

75 
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:40,300
will be a star pattern to ensure that
the wheel is flushed with the hub 

76 
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:40,879
assembly.

77 
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,249
If you don't do the star pattern

78 
00:05:44,249 --> 00:05:51,249
you could run the risk of your wheel 
falling off.

79 
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,009
Step 12 : lower the jack to bring the car
onto the ground. 

80 
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:06,389
And fully tighting the lug nuts. Tight them  as
much as you can 

81 
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:10,570
but not over tighten them preventing you
from removing the lug nuts in the future.

82 
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,350
If you purchase a new wheel assembly it
is best to have it installed 	

83 
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,350
professionally

84 
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:22,350
so that you can tighten the wheel to
specifications.

85 
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:35,280


86 
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,520
step 13 : 

87 
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,690
put all the materials and tools back in
there location.
