1 
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,949
First, remove the spare wheel,

2 
00:00:05,949 --> 00:00:11,289
jack and wheel brace from Bryce from 
the vehicle.

3 
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:15,999
If the vehicle is equipped with 
the wheel chock use it
to chalk the diagonally opposite wheel.

4 
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:19,730
Loosen the will nut before jacking.

5 
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,730
If you're having a hard time trying to
get them undone

6 
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:28,030
use your body wheigth.

7 
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,300
Find the jacking point. The jacking point is
different on

8 
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:39,300
all marks and models, so refer to your owners
manual. Make sure the jack is lifting

9 
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:41,079
nice and square.

10 
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:44,979
If not, lower and reposition. Do not risk it.

11 
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:48,810
Jack the car up slightly and place the
spare wheel 

12 
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,380
under the car just in case the car falls
of the jack.

13 
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,469
And remember to jack the car a little
bit higher

14 
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:02,250
allowing for the fully inflated tire.
When trying to remove the wheel you may

15 
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,810
find it fused on with rust.

16 
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:09,280
Some force might be needed. Remove the
flat tire

17 
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,869
and place it under the car just in case
the vehicle falls.

18 
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:19,369
When changing the tire

19 
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:24,039
never sit with your legs under the car
or put your hands at the bottom of the

20 
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:24,490
wheel.

21 
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:28,829
Before you fit the spare wheel, make sure
the hub

22 
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:32,299
and wheel studs are clean, free of dirt
and bright.

23 
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:36,800
Fit the spare wheel. Make sure the wheel
is located correctly

24 
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,470
on the hub. This is extremely important.
Some wheel nut 

25 
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,320
can go on two ways. Always remember to
put the tapper part of the wheel nut

26 
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,110
towards the wheel itself.

27 
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:51,380
then put all wheel nuts on and tight
them by hand

28 
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:58,380
before nipping them up with the brace.
Once the wheel nut are nipped up with

29 
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,140
the brace,

30 
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,240
you can start lowering the jack. Then you
can tighten them properly

31 
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:15,650
when the car is down on the ground.
Tight opposite wheel nut 

32 
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:22,650
after each other. Don't go around in a
circle. Use a stop at.

33 
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,950
Now remember if your car was equipped
with the spare tire
 
34 
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:37,430
the full-size flat tire may not fit
correctly in the re. So there you go!
