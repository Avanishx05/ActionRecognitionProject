5
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,039
First things first, to get your tools out of your trunk.

6
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:09,760


7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,850
Put the jack and it should be twisting

8
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,680
to your right to extend it.

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,119
Should be able to easily twist it by hand
until you get to the	

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,180
actual car when you want to put it on
this little lift point which is a little

11
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,309
rectangular point where you lift it up.

12
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:35,550
Then you take your hook, you put into your actual Jack.
Put your jack

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,629
on the end here. Now make sure the tires
always clear the ground and your e-brake is

14
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:41,260
set.

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,620
So that you can loosen the lug nuts
fairly

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,090
easily.

17
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,700
Pull your tire off, open your trunk lid

18
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,770
spin your actual 

19
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,110
spare tire holder off.

20
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:03,000
Pull your tire out.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,910
It helps to put your foot underneath it

22
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:11,910
to help lift it up. Line up your studs.

23
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,850
Put all your lug nuts back on.

24
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:23,220
Make sure they're tight.

25
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,360
Preferably in a star pattern. Now take your Jack off,

26
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,160
just do the reverse order to what we did
prior,

27
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,960
spin it to the left.
