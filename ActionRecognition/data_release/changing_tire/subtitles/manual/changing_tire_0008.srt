1 
00:00:00,609 --> 00:00:04,319
The first thing that we are going to do is
actually loosen the nuts on the wheel.

2 
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,870
So we are going to loosen them diagonally
across and just enough so that we can

3 
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,179
have what we call then

4 
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:13,410
hand loose. Once we've got the

5 
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,610
nuts loose, we then going to actually
jack up the car. We've already looked in

6 
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,100
the log book to find the correct

7 
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,310
jack point under the car. Place
the jack underneath

8 
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,000
so that the jack almost close not quite
open enough 

9 
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,780
and we slip them under the point.
What we're going to do is slowly jack up

10 
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,180
the car until the jack is actually
touching

11 
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,800
the point in the vehicle where it's touching
and we slowly will start to jack up

12 
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,570
the car. You'll notice the whole car will
start to lift.

13 
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,270
If we put the jack in the wrong spot you
might notice that the car is not lifting

14 
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:44,890
properly

15 
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,440
and also you'll notice that it might start
making some cracking noises.

16 
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,160
Once we've jack the car up enough and
everyone always says how do I know it's

17 
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,590
enough.

18 
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,020
Jack it up until you've got a bad of
inch or two

19 
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,220
from the tire above the actual ground
or

20 
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,650
until the jack won't go up any further.
Now what we're going to do

21 
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:08,450
is loosen the nuts even more taking
them all off and we always say put them

22 
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,900
into your pocket so you don't lose the
nuts. If you lose one or two you can

23 
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,570
always take

24 
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,789
one of each other wheel to pull back
onto the spare.

25 
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:20,519
So we put the nut into our pocket. Now
what we gonna do is

26 
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,530
actually carefully take the wheel off.  
Sustaining not to lie

27 
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,859
staying fairly close to the car and we
going to lift the wheel off.

28 
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,659
Rolling the wheel onto the ground

29 
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:36,829
and we're going to grab the spare tire.
so what we're going to do now is stand very

30 
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:37,959
close to the

31 
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:41,519
car. I actually put my body
against the car

32 
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,819
and we have to make sure that the actual
holes

33 
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:50,430
in the wheel lineup with the nuts on
the car. So what we are going to do is

34 
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,950
do that before we actually have to lift
the tire. So I have aligned all the holes up.

35 
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,480
We're going to lift it onto the wheel
and

36 
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,499
sometimes it takes a little bit of a
jiggle just to get them on.

37 
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:05,109
I hold it with my leg while I slowly
put the

38 
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:08,400
nut back on diagonally across from each
other.

39 
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,040
So that way you don't have just the top
ones on in the bottom of the wheel is

40 
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,019
spoking out all the other way around.

41 
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:17,439
So I put the nut back on I
tighten them by hand.

42 
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,889
I can then lower the car, remove the jack
out carefully

43 
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:25,170
and then I'm going to grab the wrench and
tighten

44 
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,299
the nut top again until there's tight as
I can get them. Have a check around to

45 
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:31,549
make sure there is nothing that I've left
behind

46 
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:36,459
and then pack everything back into
the bot.
