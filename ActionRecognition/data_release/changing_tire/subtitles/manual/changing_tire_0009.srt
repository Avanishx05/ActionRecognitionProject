1 
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:06,150
The first thing you want to do is
to make sure the car is in park and make
sure that the emergency brake is applied

2 
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,910
we don't want the car rolling away when
we get it off the jack. Second thing we

3 
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:11,539
want to do

4 
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:16,539
is to pop the trunk. There it is
where the rear of

5 
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:19,699
the 2013 Corolla to lifted. 

6 
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:22,890
What's in the truck : your spare tire

7 
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,200
, jack and all the tools to use it are
located under the trunk cover.

8 
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,559
Lift the flap to gain access to the
 
9 
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,590
tools. First thing you want to do

10 
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,329
is to pull these tools right off the top
and set them aside.
 
11 
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:42,559
Second thing you want to do

12 
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,570
is to use your hand to unscrew the jack

13 
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,020
in a counter clockwise motion to loosen
it up

14 
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:58,020
and pull the jack out. The third thing is
to counter clockwise

15 
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,030
unscrew the spare tire.

16 
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,210

 
17 
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,830


18 
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:17,830
And lift the spare tire out.

19 
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,120
Now we are going to pretend that this tire
is our flat tire on the side of the road. 

20 
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,310
You with better the jack

21 
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,040
there the spare tire and we've got the tools
that we need.

22 
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,240
this tool is your tire tool.

23 
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,290
This is what we will use to loosen the
lug nuts and tighten the lug nuts.

24 
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,330
This tool

25 
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:44,350
we're going to use to jack the car
up and down as we needed.

26 
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:50,040
The next step is to loosen the nuts

27 
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,920
at least one full turn because when you jack
the car up

28 
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,470
before you loosen the nuts the tire might
turned a little bit make it a bit

29 
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:04,470
harder.

30 
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,650
The next thing we want to do is to jack
the car up.

31 
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,910
For safety reasons you need to make sure
that you jack it up from the correct

32 
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,530
place.

33 
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,730
We want to put the jack as right here on
the two notches on the frame.

34 
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,890
There is two notches for the rear and there is two
notches for the front on this part

35 
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,850
of the frame.

36 
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,050
there's a slit in the jack and that's
just gonna go

37 
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,140
right up

38 
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:52,380
on that piece of the frame.

39 
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,970
Now you wanna take the jack handle

40 
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:00,100
with the loop at the end, slided it in the
hole on the jack

41 
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:07,100
and turn clockwise until the tire just
lift the ground.

42 
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,900
Now the tire is off the ground, we're gonna
finish removing the

43 
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:25,900
wheel nuts. In in this process you want
to take the bottom nuts

44 
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:30,769
off first so the tire doesn't fall

45 
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:35,049
this way as you're taking the nuts out.

46 
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:42,049
When we have all the lug nuts off, just slide
the tire right now.

47 
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,900
Okay you want to install this spare tire 
with this part of the hub sticking out 

48 
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:55,050
as seen.

49 
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,439
Push the hub down there.

50 
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,019
You gonna put the lug nuts on, taper the
end on the inside.

51 
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:08,509
Top first.

52 
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:15,509


53 
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:30,090
Putting them hand tight 

54 
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:35,310
then you gonna lower your jack.

55 
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:42,310
Lower your jack counterclockwise

56 
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,530


57 
00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:01,530
Then you are gonna to tighten your lug
nuts with the tire tool.

58 
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,870


59 
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,910


60 
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:21,910


61 
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:32,389


62 
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:36,520
Now that we're done with that stuff, that
everything is tight. You want to

63 
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,990
basically check to make sure the tires
got enough air pressure in it

64 
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,699
and it's ready to drive. Now we need to
put the tools back in the way that we

65 
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:45,169
found them.

66 
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:52,169
The first thing we want to do is put the
tire back in the compartment.

67 
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,850
Now the tire and the jack will fit
back in here

68 
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,140
but your tools of course won't. We have got
to put them on top.

69 
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,550
Now we're gonna put the jack in
its place.

70 
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,780
Like I mentioned before

71  
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,890
the other tools will not fit in there
with with full size tire so

72 
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,330
we're going to put the tools

73 
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,210
right here in the trunk. Now that we put our
tools back, we're

74 
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:30,740
gonna to close the trunk. We've completed
changing tire on the 2013

75 
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,430
Toyota Corolla.
