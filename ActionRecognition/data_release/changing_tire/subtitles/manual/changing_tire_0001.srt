1 
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,930
We are going to check the owners manual 
so you can learn

2 
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,570
where and how to use you spare tire.

3 
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,630
Oh! Tires are heavy!

4 
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,229
These are you tools to help you jack up
your car

5 
00:00:17,229 --> 00:00:20,250
and to take the old flat tire off.

6 
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,410
And,

7 
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,320
It is up to way right here : the jack.
So, using the wheel wrench, you are going to

8 
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,649
loosen the nut half a turn.

9 
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:34,649
Remember

10 
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:40,009
lefty loosely right inside it.

11 
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:44,049
Here you can see the jacking point is
this part right here on the frame.

12 
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:47,049


13 
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:51,200
Now as you remember we first loosen the
wheel nut a half turn

14 
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,590
all the way around before we jack the car.
So now what we're gonna do is

15 
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:02,229
fully remove the wheel nut and take off
the wheel cover.

16 
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:08,930
And, voila : the wheel cover!

17 
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,920
As you can see, 

18 
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,319
there is a significant difference between the 
spare

19 
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:16,959
and your actual tire.

20 
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,500
So you want to get to a tire shop ASAP.

21 
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,380
The first question you may have is :
Which side faces out?

22 
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,530
and the easiest way to check is that

23 
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,970
the air valve, this thing right here.

24 
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:38,959
always faces the outside.

25 
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,830
Then, you take the wheel wrench. Of course it is very
important to get these on

26 
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,260
as tight as you can so you make it
safely to a tire shop.

27 
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,730
So now we are going to slowly lower the car back down.

28 
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,940
You're gonna get dirty! I have to tell you :

29 
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,410
this is not a clean job. Alright if you remember

30 
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,470
the trunk is where we found the spare
and now we're gonna put the flat tire in

31 
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:04,150
here with all of our equipment and head
down the road to the tire shop

32 
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:09,130
to have an expert check things out. After
packing the bad tire into the trunk

33 
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,820
I carefully drove over.
