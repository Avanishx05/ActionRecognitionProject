1 
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:00,480
Generally speaking your spare tyre
and the toolkit are placed in
the boot of the vehicle. It

2 
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,660
does vary from car to car so check
your owner's manual and that'll identify

3 
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,380
exactly where in your particular car those items are kept.

4 
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,449
What you'll need is a wheel brace to enable you to undo the wheel nuts

5 
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:14,750
you'll also need a jack to raise the vehicle to allow you to get the flat tyre off.

6 
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,110
You start by removing the hub cap or the wheel nut covers

7 
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,680
whatever's fitted to your vehicle, then using
the wheel brace you want to loosen

8 
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,820
each of the wheel nuts half to approximately one turn before jacking up the vehicle.

9 
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,420
Next, we're going to raise the vehicle to allow us to remove the flat tyre

10 
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,660
the jacking point and the type of jack used does vary from car to car so again its worth

11 
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,550
checking your owners manual.

12 
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:39,320
Once the jack's in place you then commence jacking the vehicle to release the weight of

13 
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,019
the vehicle from the flat tyre. Now that we've got the wheel off the

14 
00:00:43,019 --> 00:00:43,460
ground.

15 
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,780
We can remove each of the wheel nuts until

16 
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,030
all 5 or 6 or 4, depending on whatever your car's fitted with are off

17 
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,760
and now we can remove the flat tyre. A good idea is to place the flat

18 
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,620
wheel under the vehicle just for a safety feature in case the jack were to give way

19 
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,770
you've then got something to support the vehicle

20 
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,340
so lift the spare wheel up onto the
hub and make sure it's sitting nice and flat

21 
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,650
and square to the vehicle.

22 
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:11,080
Then start each of the wheel nuts by hand
then remove the flat tyre from under the

23 
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,580
vehicle and

24 
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:18,050
lower the jack. Lower the vehicle down
until the weight of the vehicle is on the

25 
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,700
spare tyre that's just been fitted

26 
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,710
We'll then use the wheel brace to
tighten each of the wheel nuts

27 
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,330
in sequence. If you can't get to a tyre
repairer

28 
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,640
in the short term it's worth checking those wheel nuts again

29 
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,760
after a couple hundred kilometres of driving, just to make sure they are still tight

30 
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,060
I guess the main thing is to know your vehicle, so you should be checking that your

31 
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:37,799
spare tyre

32 
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,570
is fitted to the vehicle and inflated and
also that all of your tools

33 
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,700
are in a serviceable condition. With some
vehicles it can vary, you've got

34 
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,289
emergency spares or space savers as they are commonly called and they're only for

35 
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:53,560
literally emergency purposes to get you to a place of repair as quickly as possible

36 
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,249
when in doubt ring RACQ and we're happy
to come and assist.
