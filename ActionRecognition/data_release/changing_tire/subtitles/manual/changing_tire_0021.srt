2
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:06,109
First have it in park and on level ground. Also set your
emergency brake.

3
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:10,550
Once the brake is set, each car has a spare
tire somewhere hidden. And the jack this

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,660
one's underneath the liner in the trunk.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,359
You can use your tire iron 

6
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:21,820
to take off the hubcaps. Be careful they
can break. From the other side of your

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,150
iron, is the socket

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:30,150
and loosen all the bolts. Don't remove them,
just loosen 'em. Then slip the hook

9
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:33,550
right into the jack and if you look at your
jack

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,860
there's some markings underneath it on
Toyota's to show you where

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,620
to put your jack. There's two little markings
for each wheel.

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,460
Then lift the tire off the ground about
one inch

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:55,460
and take off all the bolts.

14
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,610
And place the new tire on

15
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:15,610
and put the blts on by hand. Once

16
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,420
each bolt is a little bit snug use your
iron

17
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,980
and then tighten diagonally from pole
to pole

18
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,600
to get all five. And tighten all of them with 
the same amount of force

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,990
Once you've done all five, start over from the first
again.

20
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:39,990
Give it a little bit more of a tweak. Then
lower the jack till the tire is on the

21
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:42,750
ground

22
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,310
and tighten the bolts the rest of the way
again. Going on

23
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:53,310
in the star pattern diagonally give it a lot of
force and lastly when you put the hub cap

24
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,080
back on
