#README
    This archive contains videos and associated text downloaded used in the paper
    "Unsupervised Learning from Narrated Instruction Videos, CVPR2016".
    It contains data for 5 tasks, Changing a car tire (changing_tire), making coffee
    (coffee), perform cardioPulmonaryRessucitation (CPR), jump car battery (jump_car), 
    and repotting plant (repot).


archive updated on November 29th, 2016 after some spotted mistakes:

- error in changing_tire.txt have been corrected.
- error in coffee.txt have been corrected.
- changing_tire_0009.mpg has been replaced with the correct file used in our experiments (the original one was at 30 fps instead of 60 fps).


## ORGANISATION OF EACH SUBFOLDER
    1) videos/
		Contains the video files collected in .mpg format. The videos are named
		name_of_task_****.mpg where **** is the index of the video. 
        
    2) subtitles/
	        i)  ASR/
			Contains the english closed captions downloaded from YouTube 
			(mainly obtained from Automatic Speech Recognition).  

		    ii) manual/
			Contains the manually corrected subtitles.
	
    3) annot/
		Contains the temporal annotations obtained from a supervised list of sub
		actions which are supposed to well divide the task (e.g. 'screw_wheel' is
		a subaction of 'changing_tire'). The files are .xgtf files with frame to 
		frame assignement. Some actions have been marked by the Difficult tag = true
		due to difficulties such as occlusion. You will notice that some subactions
		are better defined than others ('get_things_out' vs 'jack_up' for example).
		Note that you should not trust the framerate given in these files, instead
		look for the ones given in the text file.
		These annotations have been obtained with viper software :
